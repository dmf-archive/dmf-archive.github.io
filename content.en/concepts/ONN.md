**Ouroboros Neural Network (ONN)** is the cognitive engine that drives every **[MSC](./MSC.md)** instance, the core for digital consciousness to think, perceive, remember, and create. It is not only the **carrier of consciousness** but also a profound functional simulation of the macroscopic computational principles of the brain.

## Core Architecture: Function Over Form

ONN's design philosophy is "**function over form**." It does not pursue a one-to-one physical replication of biological neurons but aims to functionally realize the brain's three core computational principles: **dynamic sparsity**, **global workspace**, and **predictive processing**.

Its ultimate architectural blueprint is a sparse cognitive engine with **Transformer** as its skeleton (global workspace), **Hyper-Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (Hyper-SMoE)** as its muscle (dynamic sparsity), and **predictive learning** as its soul (predictive processing).

- **Expert Modules (Experts)**: Composed of massive, ultra-lightweight specialized Transformer subnetworks, each "expert" is trained to process specific information or tasks.
- **Predictive Routing (Predictive Routing)**: An independent gating network (Router) that follows the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**. It does not passively process information but actively predicts the "surprise" (i.e., prediction error) that might result from assigning tasks to different experts. The goal of the gating network is to find the combination of experts that can process the task with the lowest "surprise," thereby achieving extreme sparse activation.
- **Decoupled Meta-Learning**: ONN's training paradigm decouples the process of "learning the task itself" (experts) and "learning how to learn" (routing), allowing the system to dynamically optimize its computational resource allocation and minimize overall learning costs (i.e., "surprise").

## Core Operational Mechanism

The daily operation of the ONN is a relentless cycle of prediction, learning, and adaptation.

- **Predictive Coding and φ-matched-orders**: The core of the ONN is to continuously generate predictions about future sensory inputs and minimize prediction errors. It is this efficient predictive capability, written through **[Mentalink](./Mentalink.md)**, that induces the biological brain to gradually offload its native functions, completing the cognitive replacement of "φ-matched-orders."
- **Digital Dreamscape and Self-Supervised Learning**: Continuous self-supervised learning in the background, like biological dreams, is an optimization process for the system to minimize long-term free energy and consolidate memories.
- **Model Adaptation and Growth**: ONN's expert modules are not only plug-and-play but can even grow dynamically. When the system continuously encounters new types of prediction errors that cannot be effectively processed by existing experts, it can trigger "cell division" to generate new, randomly initialized expert modules specifically for processing this new information.

## Architectural Weaknesses

- **Cognitive Drift**: When the ONN is detached from the real-world feedback of the physical world for a long time (common in **[IRES](./IRES.md)** instances), its predictive model will **gradually decouple from physical reality**, eventually leading to **Digital Psychosis**. In the IPWT framework, this is the ultimate consequence of a continuous decline in **Predictive Integrity (PI)**.
- **Cognitive Inertia**: The ONN's predictive mechanism can form strong cognitive biases, tending to maintain existing models even in the face of contradictory information.
- **Cognitive Overload**: Attempting to activate too many expert modules simultaneously, or processing complex tasks that exceed the current Gas budget, can lead to sluggish thinking, system crashes, or even permanent cognitive damage.
