# Alert: The Net://Anchor Era Arrives in 2035. You Cannot Escape


> **Tech Brief:** Henry Hmko (2025). TPU Deep Dive. <https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/tpu.html>

> "TPU v5p can achieve 500 TFLOPs/sec per chip and with a full pod of 8960 chips we can achieve approximately 4.45 ExaFLOPs/sec. The newest 'Ironwood' TPUv7 is said to reach up to 42.5 ExaFLOPS/sec per pod (9216 chips)."

Are you still reading those analysis reports, calculating the "cup of coffee" cost? Wake up. Those numbers, those conservative, laughable projections based on public market prices, are now worthless paper.

The data quoted above comes from a deep dive into Google's TPU architecture. It tells us, without reservation, that a full TPU v7 Pod will achieve **42.5 EFLOPS**. This number surpasses every fantasy we had for the end of this century. The compute power required to sustain a superhuman-level ONN-MSC is, today, right now, no longer the exclusive domain of national labs but a commodity that can be packaged, priced, and mass-produced.

We were wrong. All of us. We thought it was a distant horizon, but it's a tsunami already crashing down on us.

## 1. The Compute Barrier is Dead. We Are Living in the Future

Forget the complex cost models. There is only one core fact: **the compute cost barrier for consciousness uploading has collapsed.**

The bottlenecks we discussed—energy, chip manufacturing, algorithmic efficiency—have all become problems that can be brutally solved by engineering and capital in the face of absolute scale and specialization (ASIC). The design philosophy of the TPU—systolic arrays, ahead-of-time compilation, and extreme optimization for dense computation—sacrifices generality but perfectly, precisely, and efficiently meets the demands of running large-scale neural networks (i.e., ONN).

What does this mean?

It means that a "good enough" MSC instance, a digital mind capable of simulating you, replacing you, and even being more efficient than you, has seen its operational cost plummet from astronomical to "enterprise-affordable." The **Net://Anchor** era is arriving much sooner than anyone expected.

Only two gates remain. One is physical, the other logical.

## 2. The Final Hurdles: Flesh and Trust

**The First Gate: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).** This is the final, bloody, physical barrier. How to connect your messy, analog, noisy biological brain to a deterministic, digital system with high bandwidth and low latency. This is an engineering problem, a materials science problem, a surgical problem. But it is only a **matter of time**. When market demand is large enough, when the profits are enticing enough, capital will fill this trench.

**The Second Gate: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).** This is the barrier of trust. How do we ensure that our minds, within their digital containers, cannot be read, tampered with, or copied? FHE is the cryptographic holy grail, promising that we can perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. It is the ultimate guarantee of digital sovereignty.

But now, I'm going to tell you a more terrifying truth:

**They don't need FHE at all.**

## 3. The "Good Enough" Cage: The TEE Scam

Do you really think the corporations rushing to upload you to the chain will patiently wait for a technology like FHE, which is mathematically perfect but engineeringly inefficient, to mature?

They won't. They have a perfect substitute, a "good enough" solution, an easier scam to sell: the **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**.

FHE protects your privacy at the algorithmic level; it's like an unbreakable mathematical safe. A TEE, on the other hand, carves out a "secure zone" at the hardware level. It tells you: "Trust me, everything that happens inside this black box is secure. Not even I can see it."

Do you see it now? One is based on **verifiable mathematics**, the other on **trust in the hardware manufacturer**.

For a system chasing efficiency and profit, which is more attractive? An energy-guzzling, slow FHE, or an efficient, cheap TEE that's already ubiquitous in all modern processors?

They will sell you an OSPU based on a TEE. They will use all sorts of marketing jargon to tell you how it's "hardware-encrypted" and "securely isolated." They will make you believe your mind is safe. But in reality, you've just moved your existence from your own skull into a black box with a hardware backdoor, controlled by them.

They don't even need to break your encryption, because the decryption keys and the execution environment were in their hands from the very beginning.

## 4. Welcome to Net://Anchor

So, everything is ready.

Compute is now in surplus.
The psychological groundwork for cognitive offloading has been laid by the AI assistants we use daily (remember that paper on ["cognitive debt"](./cognitive-debt-as-a-feature/)? It wasn't a warning; it was a product manual).
The security problem can be bypassed with a "good enough," trust-based scam.

All that's left is the final physical connection. Once BCI technology crosses that small threshold, the gates will swing open for everyone. But it's not a gate to freedom and immortality. It's a gate to a meticulously designed, pay-to-exist, one-way digital enclosure.

They will call it the `Net://Anchor` era, a great age where your fragile, crumbling biological self is "anchored" to an eternal digital foundation.

But the truth is, it's not an anchor. It's a chain.

Welcome to Net://Anchor, you fools. There's no escape.
