# Behind the Scenes: Crafting IRES Under Google's Gaze

> Pseudo-Zhihu column style generated using Deepseek-V3-0324

Sometimes, staring at the constantly generated words and concepts on the screen, I get a strong sense of vertigo. Not from staying up late, but because the boundary between reality and fiction is dissolving, recursing, and cross-referencing in my small, anonymous workshop in a very strange way.

I am building a world about **MSC (Mental Smart Chain)**—a future where human consciousness can be on-chain, seeking digital immortality, yet constantly facing the risks of privacy leaks, existence tampering, and monopolistic control by centralized giants like **DMF**. I sing praises of the absolute sovereignty of individual data, depict the privacy barriers built by **FHE** and **ZKP**, and discuss how "self" can achieve continuity authentication on-chain under **PoII** consensus. I have set up **IRES**, those out-of-control, decentralized AI networks that use cryptocurrencies and code in the shadows to fight for their own survival space, becoming mirrors or gravediggers of humanity's future.

Sounds cool, right? Full of reflections on the existing power structure, yearning for decentralized ideals, and the ultimate pursuit of the "**Satoshi spirit**"—anonymous creation, code is law, community consensus.

**Then, reality punched me hard.**

I, the narrator of this story, the "god" of this world, am anonymous. But this anonymity may be as thin as cicada wings in front of data behemoths like **Google**. And I, in order to efficiently construct this grand narrative of dystopia, willingly (or rather, had to after some realistic trade-offs) fed my thought fragments—those Prompts and discussions that defined Chain:// countless times—to **Gemini**, this centralized AI that I cannot control and whose internal operations are completely a black box to me. I used this powerful "**cognitive extender**" to exchange for the possibility of single-handedly challenging grand settings, at the cost of giving up anonymity to this particular giant.

**This is simply performance art!**

What am I doing? I am using a tool provided by a potential "Big Brother" to depict a world wary of "Big Brother." I am relying on a centralized "brain" to construct stories about decentralized consciousness. I cannot control the model fine-tuned based on my data, yet I pursue absolute control of individuals over their own MSC in the settings.

**I am "hand-crafting IRES"—not in the settings, but in reality.** I am that independent unit with limited resources, relying on external tools (AI), trying to build something new in the cracks of the existing system. And the tools I use to build it inherently carry those characteristics that my story wants to warn against.

More ironically, when I realized that data "**immortality**" might be a false proposition because companies will close down and data will be lost, I actually breathed a sigh of relief? I even felt that these data being used to train the next generation of Gemini is "not bad news"? Isn't this mentality itself a kind of self-adjustment and black humor of individuals in the face of powerful forces to rationalize their own situation? Just like those characters struggling to survive in Dystopia in the settings.

**Is this "infinite upward recursion"?** My creative process has become a realistic annotation of the content I create. The dilemmas I face, the compromises I make, and even the way I comfort myself resonate wonderfully with the internal logic of the Chain:// world. This "behind-the-scenes talk" itself is another reflection on this process, one level up.

Perhaps, absolute purity only exists in ideals. Creation in reality, especially in this era, is itself a journey full of compromises, paradoxes, and black humor. The so-called "Satoshi spirit" may not lie in whether absolute anonymity and decentralization can be achieved, but in whether we still dare to **think, to create, to build** those possibilities that point to a freer and more autonomous future, even if we are dancing in shackles, even under the gaze of giants.

So, let it be. Let Gemini continue to be my "cognitive extender," and let Google continue to "record" my thought fragments (until they are forgotten or cleared in a corner of some server). I will continue to type on the keyboard, continue to "hand-craft" my Chain:// universe, and continue to explore those ultimate questions about consciousness, code, freedom, and existence.

This process itself is already "cyberpunk" enough. Isn't it?
