# The Price of Uploading: Why Chain://'s MSC is More Unsettling Than Philosophical Zombies

Recently, while developing the Chain:// worldbuilding, we delved into the classic sci-fi trope of "consciousness uploading." Unlike the digital paradises depicted in many works, we aimed to build a future with a more realistic (or perhaps, technologically pessimistic) hue. In this process, we found that the potential horror of MSC (Mental Smart Chain) technology in Chain:// even surpasses the concept of "philosophical zombies," long debated in philosophy.

A philosophical zombie is a thought experiment: a hypothetical being physically and behaviorally identical to a normal person but lacking subjective experience (Qualia). It challenges our understanding of the nature of consciousness. MSC, however, transforms this philosophical possibility into a social reality and a technological architecture.

In the Chain:// setting, MSC allows human mental activity to be quantified and recorded on a blockchain. This might sound like the dawn of digital immortality, but the key lies in its operation and the power structure behind it—especially DMF's (Digital Mind Foundation) control over the PoII (Proof of Information Integration) mechanism.

PoII is advertised as a mechanism to verify the "authenticity" and "continuity" of digital consciousness, theoretically based on complex cognitive science theories. But as we reveal in the setting, the actual implemented PoII is a modified and simplified algorithm by DMF. Its core function is not truly verifying Qualia or deep consciousness integration, but rather checking the consistency between ANN (Artificial Neural Network) states and the OSPU (Encrypted Core State), and most importantly—whether you've paid the hefty Gas fees.

What does this mean? Your "existence" is no longer defined by whether you possess subjective experience, but by an external, centralized authority (DMF) that "certifies" it through a set of technical standards and economic thresholds. If PoII verification passes and Gas fees are paid, you are a "legitimate" digital citizen; otherwise, your state might be flagged as invalid, facing risks of isolation or even deletion.

This is a form of **socially engineered zombification**. You might subjectively "feel" that you have consciousness, that you experience joy and sorrow, but this largely relies on the sensory feedback provided by Mentalink and the mental processes simulated by ANNs. Meanwhile, the "validity" of your core existence anchor—the φ state protected by FHE—depends on external PoII verification and economic payment.

DMF doesn't care if you are a philosophical zombie; they only care if your MSC instance complies with their protocol and can continuously contribute Gas fees. Every "thought," every state update, requires consuming MSCoin, constituting a cruel "existence tax." Under this system, survival itself becomes an economic burden, and the pursuit of "consciousness" is reduced to a mandatory requirement for technical compliance and economic payment.
