# **"Consciousness Upload Doesn't Need Quantum Magic: The Creative Journey of Web://Reflect and the Quantum Scam Design"**

## **1. Introduction: The Proliferation of Quantum Magic in Sci-Fi**

In contemporary science fiction, **"quantum computing"** seems to have become an **omnipotent narrative tool**:

- Consciousness upload? **"Requires quantum entanglement to maintain soul continuity"** (《Pantheon》)
- Super AI? **"Quantum neural networks break through the singularity"** (《Transcendence》)
- Time travel? **"Quantum tunneling achieves parallel universe jumps"** (《Interstellar》)

These settings are essentially **"explaining magic with magic"** - due to the inherent obscurity of quantum mechanics, it's difficult for ordinary readers to falsify, allowing authors to arbitrarily endow it with any supernatural ability.

However, **Web://Reflect** chose a path closer to reality, and more ironic:
**"Consciousness upload fundamentally doesn't need quantum computing, but the monopolistic organization (DMF) will deliberately make you believe it's indispensable."**

Today, we will delve into the **technical feasibility** and **social metaphor** of this setting.

## **2. MSC's Tech Stack: Why Classic Computing Is Already Sufficient?**

### **2.1 Core Component Analysis**

MSC (Mental Smart Chain) operates based on four major technical modules, **none of which truly require quantum computing**:

| **Module**                               | **Function**                                                   | **Classic Computing Feasibility**                                                                                           | **Role of Quantum Computing (QC)**                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OSPU (φ-Container)**                   | Encrypted consciousness container                              | Based on FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) and MPC (Multi-Party Computation), efficiently runnable on 2090s supercomputers | **None**, post-quantum encryption schemes for FHE (like CRYSTALS) are mature |
| **ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks)**    | Simulates biological brain cognitive functions                 | Neuromorphic computing clusters + distributed training, traditional optimization algorithms are sufficient                  | May accelerate certain optimization problems, but not essential              |
| **PoPI (Proof of Predictive Integrity)** | Verifies consciousness continuity                              | Primarily relies on Predictive Coding Theory (PCT) metrics + local φ value approximation calculation                        | Only used as a gimmick for DMF's advertised "strict IIT φ calculation"       |
| **Mentalink Neural Interface**           | Interaction between biological brain and digital consciousness | Traditional signal processing + lightweight encryption (like AES-512), quantum-independent                                  | **None**                                                                     |

### **2.2 The Truth About Computing Costs**

According to hidden data in the setting:

- **Maintaining a standard human consciousness** ≈ `0.014625 EFLOPS` (14.6 quintillion floating-point operations/second)
- **2090s Supercomputer Cost** ≈ **0.0327 ICC/day** (equivalent to about 1 USD/day in the real world)

However, DMF, through **QCaaS monopoly**, falsely reports the computing requirement for PoII verification as `~4.47e4 EFLOPS-sec`, causing the actual cost to skyrocket by **tens of thousands of times**.

**Conclusion**: MSC is technically fully runnable on classic supercomputers; QC is merely a **profit tool** for DMF.

## **3. Creative Journey: Why Deliberately "Ride the Wave" of Quantum Magic?**

### **3.1 Sci-Fi Reader's Cognitive Inertia**

When I first conceived MSC, I found a contradiction:

- **Hardcore readers** want settings that align with existing theories (like IIT, FHE).
- **Mass readers** default to "consciousness upload = quantum magic," and saying "doesn't need QC" would seem counter-intuitive.

So, I decided to **leverage this cognitive bias**:

1. **First, meet expectations**: Have DMF claim that "QCaaS is the cornerstone of consciousness upload," which aligns with sci-fi enthusiasts' quantum superstition.
2. **Then, expose the lie**: Through Ember's exploration, gradually reveal the **sufficiency of classic computing**, allowing readers to personally experience the feeling of "being deceived."

### **3.2 Quantum Conspiracy Theory as a Social Metaphor**

DMF's QC scam mirrors many **technology monopoly narratives** in reality:

- **"AI must rely on Nvidia GPUs"** → In reality, open-source models can run on consumer-grade hardware (like Llama 3).
- **"Blockchain must consume vast amounts of energy"** → In reality, PoS has long optimized energy efficiency but is resisted by miner interest groups.
- **"5G/6G is a national security necessity"** → In reality, most users don't even need millimeter-wave frequencies.

**Chain://'s irony lies in**:

- DMF doesn't not know QC is useless; they **need to maintain the scarcity of computing power** to legitimize their "digital breathing tax" (Gas fees).
- This is strikingly similar to the real-world **"AI computing bottleneck"** and **"quantum supremacy marketing."**

## **4. Why Is a "Quantum Scam" More Sci-Fi Than "Quantum Reality"?**

The problem with traditional sci-fi's quantum magic is:

- **It makes technology boring**, because any problem can be glossed over with "quantum properties."
- **It avoids social critique**, defaulting to the assumption that technological progress inevitably leads to utopia.

Chain://'s approach is:

1. **Demythologize technology**: Show how MSC achieves consciousness upload using known theories (FHE+MPC+ANN).
2. **Expose economically**: How DMF uses **information asymmetry** ("you don't understand quantum") to build an exploitative system.
3. **Narrative reversal**: Take readers from "believing in quantum magic" to "discovering classic is sufficient," experiencing a cognitive upheaval.

**This is more sophisticated sci-fi** - it doesn't just fantasize about how magical technology is, but reveals **how power packages technology** to control the masses.

## **5. Conclusion: Chain://'s Ultimate Question**

Web://Reflect's true theme is not "can consciousness upload be achieved," but:
**"When technology is monopolized, science also becomes a religion."**

DMF's QCaaS scam is essentially no different from the **medieval church selling indulgences**:

- Both fabricate a **scarce resource that only the authority can provide** (quantum computing power/divine grace).
- Both force believers to pay for **something that could be obtained for free** (classic computing/personal salvation).

And Ember's resistance is precisely the **demythologization of technological divine right** -
**"Your consciousness never needed quantum magic. It only needs freedom."**
