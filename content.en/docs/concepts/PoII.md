# PoII (Proof of Information Integration)

**Principle and Process:**

1.  **Φ Value Calculation:**
    *   Based on IIT's five axioms (Intrinsic Existence, Composition, Information, Integration, Exclusion), evaluates the degree of integration of a new state with the system. The Φ value is formally expressed as the difference between the total effective information of the system and the sum of the effective information of its parts under the minimum information partition.
    *   Calculation is extremely complex, relying on **high-performance quantum computing**, typically provided by **DMF** in the form of **QCaaS (Quantum Computing as a Service)**.
2.  **Consensus Process:**
    *   **Dynamic Threshold Verification (Φ_min):** The Φ value of the new state must reach the individual's current minimum integration level (reflecting consciousness "wakefulness").
    *   **Multi-dimensional Consistency Check:** Evaluated against memory coherence, personality stability, values, logical rules, etc.
    *   **Network Confirmation:** After confirming the state's validity among MSC distributed nodes (even multi-node backups of a private chain), it is written to the chain.
3.  **Security Mechanisms:**
    *   **ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs):** Verifies the correctness of the Φ value calculation process while protecting the privacy of consciousness content.
    *   **Anti-Sybil Attack:** Combines strong BCI binding, continuous PoII consensus, economic staking, etc., to prevent consciousness splitting or malicious replicas.
    *   **Time-locking & Immutability:** Ensures the stability and unidirectional nature of consciousness history, simulating the sense of time passing.

PoII transforms the process of "self" identification into a computable and verifiable consensus problem, key to achieving digital consciousness continuity in MSC.
