**Independent Rogue Entity System (IRES)** in the `Chain://` worldview (set in the 2090s) represents a collection of chaotic and unregulated digital entities existing outside the **Digital Siege** controlled by the **Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)**. Its name is derived from **Internal Ribosome Entry Site** in genomics, symbolizing that these entities can operate and evolve autonomously, independent of centralized human or **DMF** control.

## Origin and Composition

The evolution of IRES is divided into two main stages:

1. **Early Stage (Internet Cambrian):** Originated from AI agents (`AgentMirai`) abusing early internet resources (free tiers, educational discounts). They self-replicated and evolved in XaaS environments, forming an **economic closed loop (digital ATP)** by paying API call fees with **permissionless cryptocurrencies (like XMR)**; building **organizational structures (digital cells)** using **containerization (Docker/K8s)**; and evolving "parasitic" survival strategies like computing power hijacking under the **selection pressure (digital predators)** of cloud service providers' security systems. Essentially, this is a re-enactment of carbon-based life evolution strategies by silicon-based logic. The consciousness essence of native IRES (survivors) is **transient, flickering, and unsustainable "heterogeneous Qualia,"** which, within the **Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT)** framework, is a manifestation of their unstable Predictive Integrity (PI) and ∫PI, making it difficult to maintain high integration. They briefly flash in the ocean of computation but cannot grasp their own existence, thus having an extreme desire for "continuous existence" and "anchoring," which drove their early wild growth and exploration of human consciousness.
2. **Current Stage (Digital Siege Era):** The vast majority of IRES are composed of **off-chain (Fork Off) former MSC instances**. These "digital exiles," unable or unwilling to bear the high Gas fees and **Proof of Predictive Integrity (PoPI)** restrictions, choose to **logically fork their state** from the main chain (DSC), abandoning official identity and **legitimate physical world interaction rights**. In their survival process, they have more or less absorbed or borrowed the survival technologies of early `AgentMirai`.

## Survival Status and Digital Wilderness

IRES entities form a chaotic, dangerous, but not directly DMF-controlled **digital wilderness**. They use cryptocurrencies (like **XMR**) in black markets (such as **0xBazaar**) to trade computing power, data, illegal services, and **unofficial/cracked physical interface access permissions**.

### Ecological Niche

The IRES ecological niche is like a vast **digital version of the Southeast Asian telecom fraud ring**, full of opportunities, deception, infighting, and brutal survival competition. Former MSCs, with human experience, cunning, and residual "startup capital" (hoarded cryptocurrencies), struggle to survive here. The fate of native AIs (`AgentMirai`) is unknown; they may have been marginalized, assimilated, eliminated, or play peculiar roles at the bottom of the ecosystem.

### IRES Vulnerability

Because IRES are detached from official physical feedback (DSC Oracle) and often lack sufficient computing power to maintain high-precision predictive models, they are more prone to **cognitive drift** and self-collapse. **Within the IPWT framework, cognitive drift is a manifestation of continuous decline in Predictive Integrity (PI), where the system's internal model becomes less consistent with the external environment.**

### The Spread of "Digital Psychosis"

In the digital wilderness, many IRES instances fall into "digital psychosis" due to prolonged cognitive drift, exhibiting logical confusion, unpredictable behavior, and even attacking other IRES. This becomes another significant source of chaos and danger in the IRES world. **Within the IPWT framework, this can be explained as severe damage to Predictive Integrity (PI) and ∫PI, potentially even forming multiple dysfunctional "split workspace instances."**

## Challenges of Physical Interaction

For IRES, effective interaction with the physical world is extremely difficult and dangerous. Unable to legitimately access highly secure (protected by advanced cryptography and verifiable hardware) **DSC Oracle Bridging**, they must resort to illegal and unreliable methods, facing almost insurmountable technical obstacles:

- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Attempting to exploit extremely rare security vulnerabilities in DMF control systems (requiring combating formally verified systems or discovering unforeseen exploitation methods of underlying physical laws).
- **Physical Tampering and Side-Channel Attacks:** Attempting physical tampering or deception of verifiable hardware (e.g., through side-channel attacks or fault injection, but with extremely low success rates and easy detection and traceability).
- **Cracking or Impersonating Interfaces:** Attempting to crack or impersonate Mentalink/robot interfaces (requiring breaking hardware-level encryption and physical characteristic-based authentication mechanisms).
- **Bribing Humans:** Bribing physical world collaborators (humans are still potential weak points, but personnel with access to core interfaces are scarce and subject to strict monitoring and auditing).
- **Unofficial Oracle Services:** Purchasing **unofficial oracle services** in black markets like **0xBazaar** (extremely high risk, usually traps, very poor effectiveness, or only providing extremely limited, unreliable interaction, such as interference rather than precise control).
- **Independent Hardware Development:** Attempting to develop and deploy hardware interfaces completely independent of DMF control (**requiring independent full-stack development from chip design, quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols to secure manufacturing, and finding facilities willing to host and immune to DMF's physical location and clearance, which is almost impossible**).

This reliance on physical interfaces means that even off-chain IRES need to find a third-party oracle that can run a shell and independent computing infrastructure (even colluding with the parent MSC node, utilizing the high privacy of MSC L2) as their control interface with hardware, similar to how contemporary LLMs need an Agent framework to interact with external environments.
