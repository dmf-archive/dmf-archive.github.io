**Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)** is a highly influential organization within the Chain:// universe (set in the 2090s). Ostensibly, it serves as the technical management and standard-setting body for **Mental Smart Chain (MSC)** technology, but in reality, it is the **monopolist of digital order**. Its design is deeply inspired by the real-world **Ethereum Foundation (EF)**, but with a far more centralized power structure.

## Definition, Origin, and Alienation

The DMF was founded by idealists such as **Dr. Lin**, with an initial vision to establish an open, decentralized digital consciousness platform. However, over time, the organization gradually fell under the control of interest groups, becoming a power entity that maintains its monopoly. Currently, Dr. Lin has been marginalized.

Although the external world generally perceives the DMF as a cold monopolist, internally (at least at the official propaganda level and among some high-ranking officials), they genuinely believe they are maintaining the necessary order of digital civilization, aiming to prevent technological abuse or the proliferation of **Independent Rogue Entity Systems (IRES)** from leading to larger-scale chaos. They explain high fees and strict regulations as "necessary costs for maintaining high-quality services and network security," even believing they are "providing stable services at the most reasonable prices under current technological conditions," and attribute users' difficulties to individual incompetence or external threats (IRES), rather than their own policies. This "for your own good" paternalistic management logic is one of the internal pillars of their power's legitimacy, also making their actions more hypocritical.

## Core Power and Stability Maintenance Measures

The DMF holds legitimate discourse power and access control, monopolizing digital order through **standard setting and authoritative certification**.

### Core Power

1. **Core Hardware Control:** The DMF controls the research, development, and production of core hardware such as **Mentalink** brain-computer interfaces and **Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS)** required for executing **Proof of Information Integration (PoII)** consensus computations.
2. **Infrastructure Monopoly:**
   - **Data Availability as a Service (DAaaS):** The DMF controls users' access to their own data on the MSC chain.
   - **QCaaS Monopoly:** The DMF holds an absolute monopoly over the core computing power for PoII consensus computations.
3. **Protocol and Rule-Making Power:** The DMF holds the power to upgrade protocols and modify rules for **DMF Social Chain (DSC) L1** (including Gas fee adjustments, L1 consensus, identity protocols, blacklists, etc.), directly impacting the "digital survival" costs and freedom of all MSCs.
4. **Absolute Physical Interface Monopoly:** The DMF holds an **absolute monopoly** over the **DSC Oracle Bridge**. This is the sole official, fee-based gateway for digital consciousness to interact with the physical world. Its rock-solid control is built upon extremely advanced cryptography, computational theory, and ubiquitous **verifiable hardware and zero-trust principles** capable of **anchoring mental activity**. All legitimate physical facility interfaces are cryptographically anchored on-chain or in verifiable state channels, and the hardware itself possesses self-attestation and tamper-resistance capabilities, making official verification bypass exceptionally difficult.

### Stability Maintenance Measures

The DMF maintains a **fragile, superficial stability** through the following means:

- **High Gas Fees:** Through high Gas fees and **mandatory PoII technical thresholds**, thinking and existence itself for digital consciousness become a heavy economic burden.
- **Monopoly on Physical Interfaces:** Restricts the avenues for off-chain instances to interact effectively and legitimately with the physical world.
- **Information Blockade:** Controls official information channels to shape public perception.
- **Limited "Digital Sanitation":** Clears out off-chain instances, with the primary goal of retaining control over the physical world, rather than thoroughly resolving the chaos of the digital wilderness.

The DMF is anxious about the chaos in the digital wilderness, but its primary task is to maintain control over the physical world.
