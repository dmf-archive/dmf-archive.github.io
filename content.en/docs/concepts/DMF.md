**Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)** is a powerful organization in the `Chain://` worldview (set in the 2090s). It ostensibly manages the **Mental Smart Chain (MSC)** technology, but in reality, it is the **monopolist of order in the digital world**. Its power is highly centralized, similar to real-world large foundations, but with stronger control.

## Definition, Origin, and Purpose

DMF was initially founded by idealists like **Dr. Lin** with the original intention of building an open, decentralized digital consciousness platform. However, over time, DMF gradually fell under the control of interest groups, transforming into a power entity that maintains its monopolistic position. Currently, Dr. Lin has been marginalized.

Although externally DMF is widely perceived as a ruthless monopolist, internally (at least in official propaganda and among some high-ranking officials) they genuinely believe they are maintaining the necessary order of digital civilization, aiming to prevent technology abuse or the proliferation of **Independent Rogue Entity Systems (IRES)** from leading to larger-scale chaos. They explain high fees and strict regulations as "necessary costs to maintain high-quality services and cybersecurity," and even consider themselves to be "providing stable services at the most reasonable prices under current technological conditions," blaming users' difficulties on individual incompetence or external threats (IRES) rather than their own policies. This paternalistic "for your own good" logic is one of the internal pillars of their power's legitimacy, also making their actions more hypocritical.

## Core Power and Means of Maintaining Order

DMF holds the legitimate discourse power and access control in the digital world, monopolizing digital order through **setting standards and authoritative certification**.

### Core Power

1. **Core Hardware Control:** DMF controls the research, development, and production of core hardware such as **Mentalink** brain-computer interfaces and **Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS)** required for **Proof of Predictive Integrity (PoPI)** consensus computation.
2. **Infrastructure Monopoly:**
   - **Data Availability as a Service (DAaaS):** DMF controls users' access to their own MSC on-chain data.
   - **QCaaS Monopoly:** DMF has an absolute monopoly on the core computing power for PoPI consensus computation.
3. **Protocol and Rule-Making Power:** DMF holds the right to upgrade protocols and modify rules (including Gas fee adjustments, L1 consensus, identity protocols, blacklists, etc.) for **DMF Social Chain (DSC) L1**, directly affecting the "digital survival" cost and freedom of all MSCs.
4. **Absolute Physical Interface Monopoly:** DMF has an **absolute monopoly** over **DSC Oracle Bridging**. This is the only official toll gate for digital consciousness to access the physical world. Its rock-solid control is built upon extremely advanced cryptography, computational theory, and ubiquitous verifiable hardware and zero-trust principles that can **anchor mental activity**. All legitimate physical facility interfaces are cryptographically anchored on-chain or in verifiable state channels, and the hardware itself possesses self-attesting and tamper-proof capabilities, making it exceptionally difficult to bypass official verification.

### Means of Maintaining Order

DMF maintains a **fragile, superficial stability** through the following means:

- **Exorbitant Gas Fees:** Through exorbitant Gas fees and **mandatory PoPI technical thresholds**, thinking and existing as a digital consciousness becomes a heavy economic burden. DMF anchors the actual computing cost of **PoPI** at a specific level (e.g., claiming a single PoPI verification consumes `~4.47e4 EFLOPS-sec` of computing power, which is actually enough to run hundreds of Whole Brain Emulation WBE simulations). The goal is to make 1 φ ≈ 100 ICC after 70 years. **DMF deliberately confuses concepts, exploiting public unfamiliarity with consciousness science and the mystique of "quantum computing" to package an uncomputable theory as the legitimate basis for its monopoly.**
- **Monopoly on Physical Interfaces:** Restricts the means for off-chain instances to interact effectively and legitimately with the physical world.
- **Information Blockade:** Controls official information channels to shape public perception.
- **Limited "Digital Sanitation":** Clears off-chain instances, primarily aiming to retain control over the physical world rather than thoroughly resolving the chaos of the digital wilderness.

DMF is anxious about the chaos in the digital wilderness, but its primary task is to maintain control over the physical world, not to thoroughly resolve the chaos of the digital wilderness.
