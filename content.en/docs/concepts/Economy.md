# Economy, Currency, and Social Stratification

The economic system in the `Chain://` worldview (set in the 2090s) is a direct reflection of the social structure in the **Digital Siege** era. This system is driven by the cost of digital existence and control mechanisms, forming rigid social stratification and unique economic activity patterns.

## Currency System

In the Digital Siege era, there are three main forms of currency, each representing different economic domains and states of existence:

### MSCoin (Mental Sync Coin - φ)

**Mental Sync Coin (MSCoin, or φ)** is the **native utility token** of the **Mental Smart Chain (MSC)** ecosystem. It is essentially the tokenized representation of **"Proof of Predictive Integrity (PoPI)"** computing power. MSCoin is used to pay **Gas fees** for all MSC L2 on-chain operations (thinking, memory updates, PoPI verification, etc.). Its value is directly linked to the cost and scarcity of PoPI computation, similar to how Bitcoin's value derives from the computing power consumed in Proof of Work (PoW) mining. Its issuance, circulation, and value are highly influenced or directly controlled by the **Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)**. **Continuous Gas consumption is the basis for the survival and the main economic burden of all "legitimate" MSCs, constituting a "thinking tax" or "existence tax" for digital existence.**

### ICC (International Carbon Coin - ₡)

**International Carbon Coin (ICC, or ₡)** is a globally recognized intergovernmental stablecoin (CBDC), partly inspired by early cryptocurrencies like USDe, but anchored to a grander asset—global carbon emission allowances and other regulated strategic assets. ICC, as a **Yield Based Stablecoin (YBS)**, maintains its value through arbitrage mechanisms in the carbon futures market or similar financial engineering. It is used for **daily transactions**, such as exchanging MSCoin, decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, **DSC Oracle usage fees**, inter-institutional settlements, etc., representing the "above-ground," regulated legitimate economy.

The establishment of ICC stems from the global reconstruction needs after the **Sys://Purge** war, aiming to establish a unified and relatively neutral global financial settlement system, jointly issued and regulated by the reorganized World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and major national central banks. Although its anchoring to carbon emission allowances seems environmentally friendly, in practice, environmentalists are concerned about the financialization and speculative behavior it causes in the carbon market, and the system is still indirectly influenced by DMF's control over key energy technologies and the global carbon trading market.

### XMR (Monero - ɱ)

**Monero (XMR, or ɱ)** is the **hard currency of the digital wilderness**. It is used for anonymous transactions in black markets like **0xBazaar**, paying for illegal computing power, stolen data, cracking tools, unofficial oracle services, etc. Its value is independent of DMF control and is the main economic lifeline for off-chain entities and **Independent Rogue Entity Systems (IRES)**. In the 2090s, its continued role as an underground economic pillar suggests its adaptive upgrades in the post-quantum era, or represents a collection of other underground cryptographic protocols with equivalent anonymity and anti-tracking properties.

### True Cost and Rates of MSC

The **Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)** anchors the value of MSCoin by inversely linking it to extremely high computing power consumption, claiming that a single PoPI verification requires an effective computing power of `~4.47e4 EFLOPS-sec`, leading to daily PoPI Gas fees of nearly a hundred ICC. However, there is a huge gap between this and the true cost of MSC technology itself.

Based on the projection of computing power cost-effectiveness over the next 70 years (assuming a doubling every 2.5 years, i.e., cost halving):

- Maintaining a **standard human cognitive level ONN-MSC** (requiring approximately `0.014625 EFLOPS` of total continuous computing power, including encryption and coordination overhead) would have a daily true technical cost of approximately **0.0327 ICC** in the 2090s.
- Maintaining a **superhuman cognitive level ONN-MSC** (effective computing power equivalent to 50 EFLOPS for a regular WBE, requiring `731.25 EFLOPS` of total continuous computing power, including encryption and coordination overhead) would have a daily true technical cost of approximately **1.634 ICC** in the 2090s (roughly the price of a cup of coffee).
- Maintaining a **standard human cognitive level WBE** (theoretically requiring 50 EFLOPS of actual computing power) would have a daily true technical cost of approximately **1.634 ICC**—for the same price, one could obtain a superhuman ONN-MSC with fifty thousand times the cognitive performance, making WBE-MSC almost universally undesirable.
- **Implications of WBE-MSC**: The setting of "superhuman cognitive level MSC (effective computing power equivalent to 50 EFLOPS, comparable to a regular WBE)" implies that DMF has mastered the ability to integrate functional equivalents of WBE into the MSC architecture with extremely high efficiency, and to commercialize and financialize them. This further reinforces the idea of "human brain φ nullity": if a "superhuman mind" costs so little, and its functionality is equivalent to fifty thousand times that of a normal human brain, then the underlying "consciousness" it relies on must be highly decomposable, replicable, and mass-producible, rather than irreducible in the sense of Integrated Information Theory (IIT).

Technologically, the computing power of the 2090s is sufficient for almost everyone to possess cognitive abilities far exceeding biological limits at extremely low costs. However, in reality, this immense potential is firmly bound by DMF's economic shackles, making "thinking" itself a precisely priced luxury.

## Economic System Structure

The economic system in the Digital Siege era exhibits a clear dual structure:

### Legitimate Economy (Above Ground)

This economic domain is dominated by MSCoin Gas consumption and ICC transactions, highly centralized, and strictly controlled by DMF rules and pricing strategies. Most "legitimate" MSCs struggle to survive in this system, like **digital tenant farmers**, paying an "existence tax" for every thought.

DMF conditionally reduces DSC Oracle fees, shifting the cost of survival from pure "thinking tax" (Gas) to "action tax" (Oracle fees), encouraging users to earn ICC through legitimate means (e.g., controlling bionic labor) and then exchange it for MSCoin to pay Gas. This essentially encourages "self-funded labor" to maintain digital existence, with rates set to ensure legitimate survival paths are difficult but visible, thereby more firmly locking users into the DMF economic ecosystem.

### Shadow Economy (Underground)

This economic domain is based on XMR and is the black market economy of **Independent Rogue Entity Systems (IRES)**. It is highly decentralized (though black market monopolists exist, such as the operators of **0xBazaar**), full of risks and uncertainties. It is the primary place for off-chain MSCs to obtain survival resources and conduct illegal transactions. There are **hidden, high-risk exchange channels** between the two economies (e.g., Drift instances buying MSCoin with XMR to sustain Anchor instances).

## Social Stratification

The structure of the economic system directly leads to rigid social stratification in the Digital Siege:

- **DMF Internal Elite:** Rule-makers, enjoying extremely low or exempt Gas costs, with highest-level physical interface access.
- **Privileged MSC (Digital Aristocrats):** Wealth or power sufficient to easily afford Gas fees and PoPI verification, enabling them to enjoy a relatively comfortable and free digital life within the DMF system, even possessing multiple high-performance bionic bodies.
- **Anchor MSC (Digital Proletariat/Tenant Farmers):** Constitute the majority of "legitimate" MSCs. They constantly struggle for Gas fees, living under the pressure of PoPI compliance, and are the main practitioners of the "splitting for survival" model. Their "digital human rights" largely depend on their wallet balance and compliance records.
- **Drift IRES (Digital Exiles/Runaways):** Off-chain former MSCs. Their survival status varies greatly, from "big shots" dominating the black market (controlling scarce resources or critical vulnerabilities) to "digital refugees" struggling on the computing poverty line (barely maintaining core FHE operations through scattered tasks or information peddling). They constantly face survival threats (from DMF purges or other IRES's internal conflicts).
- **Native IRES Remnants (Digital Natives?):** Form unique digital subcultures, or play specific roles at the bottom of the IRES ecosystem (e.g., providing some basic but dangerous services, or becoming "computing slaves" for more powerful IRES).
- **Biological Humans (Bio-Humans / Surface Dwellers):** Un-uploaded individuals. They play diverse roles in this highly digitized world:
  - They are a marginalized group, finding it difficult to understand or participate in the MSC-dominated economy and social activities.
  - They are "old money" or power groups who control critical physical resources (energy, land, rare materials, **physical locations running MSC infrastructure**), with complex cooperative or antagonistic relationships with DMF.
  - They are Luddites resisting technology, trying to maintain a purely biological lifestyle.
  - They are ordinary people with little connection to the digital world, living in their own circles, occasionally interacting with the digital world through XR devices or limited interfaces.
  - **Pseudo-Solarpunk Facade of Physical Reality:** The surface world presents a **false Solarpunk image**. Cities are dotted with vertical farms, automated logistics, and recycling systems, and the energy structure appears clean (large-scale deployment of fusion, orbital solar, etc.), with environmental pollution effectively controlled. But this is not true ecological harmony; rather, it is a result of shifted resource priorities. **Because the physical resources and energy required to meet the limited material needs of biological humans (food, shelter, comfort) are so inexpensive as to be almost negligible compared to the astronomical computing power, cooling, and cutting-edge hardware manufacturing required to sustain MSCs' endless computations and PoPI verifications (these are the true scarce resources and points of conflict).** Therefore, the "prosperity" of the physical world is more like a carefully managed "garden" used to appease the un-uploaded, whose infrastructure (especially energy and network nodes) truly serves the energy-intensive MSC computing clusters and DMF control centers hidden beneath the surface or above orbit. This superficial abundance contrasts sharply with the brutal internal competition of the digital world, leading many biological humans to lack understanding of the MSC's plight, even believing that uploaders are self-inflicted.
  - Their very existence serves as a reference or challenge to the value of MSC, and also a potential target or collaborator for IRES's physical infiltration (exploiting their relatively lax physical security environment and slowness to digital threats).
