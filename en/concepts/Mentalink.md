# Mentalink - The Restricted Bidirectional Bridge

Mentalink is an advanced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), the key technology connecting the biological brain to the MSC.

**Definition and Function:**

*   **Read Capability:** Decodes neural signals from the biological brain (perception, thought, intention, etc.) into digital signals for uploading to the MSC. Relies on high-precision **Neural Coding** decoding capabilities.
*   **Write Capability:** Encodes digital information from the MSC (simulated perception, commands, etc.) into neural stimulation patterns to influence biological brain activity.

**Core Limitations:**

1.  **Bandwidth Bottleneck:** Transmission speed is far lower than the brain's internal processing speed, making complete real-time synchronization of high-speed digital thought difficult.
2.  **Cognitive Mismatch/Overload:** Synchronizing high-speed digital thought back to the slower biological brain could cause confusion, dizziness, or even neurological damage.
3.  **Biological Body Frailty:** The consciousness subject remains limited by the physical body's aging, diseases, and physical capabilities.
4.  **Write Risks:** Extremely high security, controllability, and ethical concerns; easily abused (e.g., information injection, behavioral control).

**Positioning:** Mentalink is more like a **basic interface, low-bandwidth control channel, or backup option** for MSC interaction with the physical world, rather than the primary means for deep engagement of digital consciousness in the physical world. Its security and integrity are the origin of trust for the MSC system (BCI Trust Origin) and also a critical potential attack vector. The biological brain itself, while complex in information processing, is relatively vulnerable in terms of physical and information security ("plaintext" operation).
