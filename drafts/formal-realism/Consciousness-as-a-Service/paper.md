_Abstract:_  
This paper explores the ethical and economic implications of implementing consciousness-like processes on blockchain architectures. We analyze a hypothetical framework where cognitive functions are quantified as computational tasks requiring continuous resource expenditure (Gas fees), analogous to smart contract execution. By examining the technical requirements for _Proof of Information Integration (PoII)_—a proposed mechanism to validate state continuity in such systems—we highlight potential risks of centralized control over critical infrastructure (e.g., quantum computing services). We argue that without careful design, such systems risk creating _de facto_ cognitive stratification, where access to "digital existence" becomes contingent on economic capacity. This work contributes to discussions on decentralized cognition, computational ethics, and the commodification of cognitive processes in emerging technologies.

### **Revised Outline**

#### **1. Introduction**

1.1. Motivation: Blockchain’s expanding scope beyond finance (DeFi, DAOs) to cognitive architectures.  
1.2. Research Gap: Lack of ethical frameworks for resource-dependent "consciousness-like" systems.  
1.3. Thesis: PoII and Gas-based cognitive models may inadvertently replicate socioeconomic inequalities in digital domains.

#### **2. Technical Foundations**

2.1. _Hypothetical_ Cognitive Blockchain Architecture:

- **Encrypted Core State (φ):** FHE-protected state continuity (theoretical).
- **ANN Clusters:** Predictive coding models as computational substrates.
- **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Privacy-preserving cognitive process outsourcing.  
  2.2. **Proof of Information Integration (PoII):**
- Inspired by IIT, but _practically_ simplified for tractability (e.g., PCT-based metrics).
- Computational bottlenecks: Quantum advantage claims vs. realistic cost models.

#### **3. Economic and Control Risks**

3.1. **Gas Fees as Cognitive Rent:**

- Microtransactions for "thinking" create perverse incentives (e.g., suppressing deep cognition).  
  3.2. **Centralization Pressures:**
- QCaaS dependency as a single point of failure/control.
- Case study: How "necessary infrastructure" can gatekeep access (cf. cloud computing monopolies).  
  3.3. **Stratification Effects:**
- "Cognitive poverty": Resource-constrained agents forced into suboptimal states.
- Emergence of shadow economies (analogous to off-chain computation in today’s blockchains).

#### **4. Ethical and Societal Implications**

4.1. **Agency and Autonomy:**

- Can a resource-constrained system exhibit genuine autonomy?  
  4.2. **Commodification of Cognition:**
- Parallels to gig economy mental labor (e.g., content moderation, AI training).  
  4.3. **Regulatory Challenges:**
- Who governs "digital existence" thresholds? (Compare: GDPR’s "right to be forgotten").

#### **5. Mitigation Proposals**

5.1. Technical:

- Decentralized PoII validation (e.g., threshold cryptography).
- Subsidized "cognitive base income" via protocol design.  
  5.2. Governance:
- Anti-monopoly mechanisms for QCaaS providers.
- Open-source benchmarks for PoII fairness.

#### **6. Conclusion**

6.1. Summary: CaaS models risk exporting real-world inequities to digital minds.  
6.2. Call to Action: Preemptive ethical audits for cognitive architectures.
