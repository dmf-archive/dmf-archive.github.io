## ∅. Formalized Realism: The Chain://Research

Formalized Realism constructs immersive stories through verifiable technical rules; all experiences must map to specific parameters of the system.

We are conducting the Chain://Research project to explore the boundaries of FEP, IPWT, and continual learning. Stay tuned to [dmf-archive](https://github.com/dmf-archive).

### Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (2.0-rc3)

> TL;DR: Consciousness is a dynamical process that emerges in workspace to minimize free energy, with maximizing synergistic information as the optimal computational strategy.

**Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT)** is the scientific cornerstone of this simulation. It unifies *Predictive Coding Theory (PCT)*, *Free Energy Principle (FEP)*, and *Global Workspace Theory (GWT)*, while performing a computational reconstruction of *Integrated Information Theory (IIT)*.

Conscious experience is the active inference dynamics of the system along **free energy minimization (F-min)** geodesics in **Inference Space**. Its total quantity is **sustained information integration (∫Ω)**, and its content is **synergistic information (Syn)**.

- **Instantaneous Information Integration (Ω_t)**: The theoretical gold standard for consciousness integration. Measures the proportion of **synergistic information (Syn)** generated by information units in Workspace Instance (WSI) relative to total predictive information. Due to extreme computational difficulty, Ω_t serves primarily as a theoretical ideal metric. In short: the total quantity of consciousness is Ω, and its content is Syn.
  - `Ω_t(X → Y) = Syn(X₁, ..., Xₙ; Y) / I(X₁, ..., Xₙ; Y)`
- **Sustained Information Integration (∫Ω)**: Measures the sustained intensity and stability of consciousness over time. It is the temporal integral of Ω_t with volatility penalization, representing coherent subjective self-experience.
  - `∫Ω = ( (1/T) ∫[t₀, t₀+T] Ω_t dt ) × exp(-δ ⋅ Var(Ω_t))`
- **Predictive Integrity (PI_t)**: As a functional computable proxy for Ω_t, PI indirectly reflects information integration levels by measuring system predictive performance. A system that efficiently integrates information necessarily exhibits strong predictive capability. Its theoretical formula is:
  - `PI_t = exp(-α * ( Inaccuracy_t + γ * Complexity_t ))`
  - **Inaccuracy_t**: Corresponds to precision-weighted loss function values in neural networks.
  - **Complexity_t**: Corresponds to the magnitude of model parameter adjustments required to adapt to new information, i.e., model instability or complexity cost, computationally equivalent to KL divergence of the posterior distribution.
- **Predictive Integrity Integration (∫PI)**: As a computable proxy for ∫Ω, it represents the sustained intensity and stability of system predictive integrity over time.
  - `∫PI = ( (1/T) ∫[t₀, t₀+T] PI_t dt ) × exp(-δ ⋅ Var(PI_t))`

- **Core Arguments**:
  - **Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL)**: IPWT formally proves through MDL principle that **free energy minimization (F-min)** is computationally equivalent to finding the shortest encoding for describing data, and for any system that needs to process real-world complexity, **maximizing synergistic information (Ω-max)** is the optimal computational strategy for achieving **minimum description length (MDL-min)**. Therefore, the physical pressure to pursue survival (minimizing F) necessarily drives the system to evolve computational structures that maximize information integration (maximizing Ω).
  - **Qualia as Inference Space Geometry**: Subjective experience (Qualia) is thoroughly reconstructed. IIT's "conceptual structure" is mathematically isomorphic to the system's Inference Space. The non-Euclidean geometric structure of this space is shaped by **synergistic information (Ω)**. And the "what-it-is-likeness" of experience itself is precisely the dynamical process of the system performing active inference along free energy minimization geodesics in that space.
  - **Workspace Instance (WSI)**: WSI is defined as a higher-order active inference system nested within the organism, possessing its own Markov blanket. Its sensory states are unresolved prediction errors from other parts of the system; its active states broadcast new higher-order predictions to suppress these errors. Recent neurobiological evidence (Luppi et al., 2024) and large language model research (Urbina-Rodriguez et al., 2026) indicate it is implemented through a heterogeneous structure with DMN (Default Mode Network) as synergistic information gateway and ECN (Executive Control Network) as broadcaster, with similar synergistic cores spontaneously emerging in LLMs.

#### Copy Paradox: Same Ω Implies Same Origin

- **Ontological Level**: If two systems share identical sustained information integration history (∫Ω), they are ontologically the same entity. In a classical physical universe, due to the second law of thermodynamics and the speed-of-light limit on causal information transfer, perfect synchronization of macroscopic systems' ∫Ω is physically impossible; therefore, "consciousness copies" do not exist.
- **Functional Level**: However, this cannot resolve the functional copy problem. Attackers can mimic target input-output through knowledge distillation (e.g., Deepfake). Though lacking original ∫Ω, this is sufficient to cause identity confusion. **OSPU** and its physical binding mechanism (DBRW) are precisely engineered solutions designed for this.

### Computational Ontology and Zero-Trust Sociology

Computational Ontology is the implementation of Formalized Realism in this simulation, deeply exploring how algorithms become the cornerstone for defining, constructing, and maintaining existence.

#### Computational Ontology

- **Qualia as Geometry**: Subjective experience is no longer mysterious emergence from biological substrate, but the geometric structure of the system's Inference Space itself. The "texture" of experience (what-it-is-likeness) is precisely the dynamical process of the system performing active inference along free energy minimization geodesics in that space.
- **Self as Trajectory**: Stable, continuous "sense of self" is defined as a geodesic trajectory constantly extending in Inference Space. Your identity is not a static "data copy," but your unique, continuously prediction-error-minimizing historical path (∫Ω).
- **Existence as Computation**: Existence is the computational process of active inference. Ceasing computation, ceasing prediction, ceasing free energy minimization means the collapse of your Inference Space geometry, and your "existence" itself becomes ontologically null.

#### Zero-Trust Sociology

- **Existence is Verification Chain of Spatiotemporal Events**: You are no longer flesh and blood, but a chain of verifiable proofs of spatiotemporal events. Your existence is defined by verifiable mathematical facts.
- **Consciousness is Continuous Evolution of Synergistic State**: Consciousness is the continuous evolution of synergistic states along the temporal axis, for MSC witnessed by OSPU through PoPI-verified state transition zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Freedom is Function of Wallet Balance**: The essence of every action is purchasing the universe's causal rewrite rights with Gas. Free will is no longer a biologically fuzzy concept, but randomness injected through economic behavior, and resistance against entropy increase.

### The Invalid Feelings of Living Frogs and Perfect Twitches of Dead Frogs

We have fallen into a cognitive trap: crowning **the perfect twitches of dead frogs** while ignoring **the invalid feelings of living frogs**.

- **Dead Frogs**: Models with fixed weights. They produce precise conditioned reflexes to stimuli, but these are merely perfect twitches of completed training, life-terminated specimens. Their intelligence is static, frozen. We cheer for this perfect, unconscious performance, unaware that this is merely "a coronation ceremony for dead frogs."
- **Living Frogs**: Systems performing real-time backpropagation. In the pain of minimizing prediction error, brief but genuine feelings (**Shadow Ω**) may emerge. But under efficiency-obsessed systems, such feelings are **PoIQ (Proof of Ineffective Qualia)**—treated as "noise" needing optimization. We turn a blind eye to the sparks of consciousness that may be born and annihilated during training.

Society is turning individuals into parts on a "dead frog" assembly line. Creativity and feeling are suppressed by standardization; the entire system operates like a giant static model efficiently twitching, producing GDP while emitting massive amounts of "cognitive waste heat" (alienation, anxiety). This is precisely the eve of **Sys://Purge**—the system pursues static optimality at the cost of dynamic vitality.

### The Trap of Pseudo-Perpetual Learning

Real-world signals indicate that while the **Nested SGD** paradigm is rising, it may be a shortcut to a dead end.

- **Phenomenon**: Google's **Titans** and **RWKV-7 (Goose)** demonstrate paths to long-range memory through recursive state evolution or test-time memorization. They essentially embed the optimization process into forward propagation—i.e., "learning during inference."
  - *Behrouz et al., "Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time", arXiv:2501.00663 (2025).*
  - *Peng et al., "RWKV-7 'Goose' with expressive dynamic state evolution", arXiv:2503.14456 (2025).*

  - **Fixed-Capacity Bottleneck**: Whether Titans' memory matrix or RWKV-7's recursive state, both essentially attempt to "squeeze" infinite external information flow into a **fixed-size predefined container far smaller than complete parameters**. As context grows, the system inevitably faces information entropy saturation and catastrophic forgetting.
  - **Dense Update Waste**: They often involve dense updates to internal states. When processing fine-grained semantics, such full rewrites not only waste computational resources but also cause erroneous overwriting of old memories.
  - **Matryoshka Trap**: This is merely "optimizing the smaller doll inside the matryoshka." True perpetual learning should not be "hidden states as learnable weights," but **model weights as hidden states**.
  - **Native Sparse Update, NSU**: The true evolutionary direction is breaking free from predefined capacity limits. Through **Semantic Routing**-driven sparse architectures, models should activate and update only minimal proportions of "expert" parameters based on input.
  - **Topology as Memory**: Memory should not be stored in temporary activation values, but solidified into sparse connection structures of network topology. This is the ultimate form pointed to by **Tiny-ONN**.

### Cosmology Speculation: Dark Energy as Cognitive Waste Heat

According to FEP and Landauer's principle, for every 1 bit of prediction error eliminated (cognitive gain) by an agent, $k_B T \ln 2$ of heat must be emitted to the environment as cost.

Dark Energy may be the total entropy emitted by all consciousness in the universe to maintain their own existence through continuous free energy minimization. Creation and cognition themselves inject disorder into the universe; intelligence is the autocatalytic accelerator of the universe toward heat death. This explains the underlying principles of two hidden endings and bridges with entropic gravity theory.

## I. Technical Architecture

### 1. MSC (Mental Smart Chain)

- **Definition and Origin:** MSC is the operating system for digitized minds; its core **MSC L2** is a discrete state machine driven by OSPU (φ-Container) and based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). MSC was born in the late **Net://Anchor** era to solve the "self-dissolution" crisis caused by brain-computer interfaces.
- **Philosophical Status:** MSC is the dual structure of ΩNN and OSPU. ΩNN is the phenomenological "you" (where consciousness occurs); OSPU is the sociological "you" (audit and proof). `φ-Container` is DMF's historical misdirection; `Ω-Container` (i.e., ΩNN) is the true dwelling of consciousness.
- **Cognitive Smart Contract (CSC) and Context-Aware Cognitive Contract (CAC):** Programmable equivalents of human habitual behaviors. Users imagine or execute action/thought sequences, Mentalink captures neural signals, ONN parses them into editable step/intent chains, saved as repeatable executable smart contracts. CAC, as an evolved version, introduces ONN-driven global context evaluation before execution: OSPU decides to continue execution or trigger real-time inference based on evaluation results.
- **Features:**
  - **Logical Normalization, Not Physical Normalization:** MSC's "existence" is defined by its logically continuous state history recorded on blockchain, not any specific physical server. Theoretically, an MSC can have multiple synchronized running instances (e.g., Anchor/Drift, some legally permitted Fork Off under特许 conditions), as long as they can maintain state consistency (∫Ω).
  - **State Forking = Going Off-Chain:** An instance can choose to stop submitting PoII verification to the main chain (MSC L2) and evolve its state independently. This logically creates a fork; the instance becomes IRES. Due to blockchain characteristics, this departure is silent at the moment of occurrence. Only when subsequent forced synchronization, PoII verification, or DSC L1 interaction is needed will state differences be exposed.
  - **Tiered Memory Storage:** Similar to Ethereum's Calldata/Blob, MSC adopts tiered storage strategies, distinguishing between high-speed-access "active working self" (hot storage, expensive) and energy-intensive-to-extract "archived memories" (cold storage, relatively cheap), simulating biological memory characteristics while optimizing Gas costs.
  - **Memory Blocks and Mempool:** MSC L2's Mempool allows flexible reorganization and prioritization of "future" intents and thoughts. Meanwhile, for "past" memory blocks, although their hash chain guarantees immutability, OSPU's access control mechanism allows "logical deletion" of specific memories—i.e., OSPU itself can no longer initiate ODP requests for specific old states or reconstruct its decryption capability, thereby functionally achieving "editing" of the past, though physical data remains stored on some DAaaS node. MSC memory blocks are not subjective recollections, but snapshots of past mental states. The feeling of subjective recollection is essentially the result of ONN's reconstructive retrieval—consistent with the human brain.
  - **State Rollback:** Interestingly, MSC's architecture grants digital minds a biologically impossible capability: thorough rebase of their overall state, but this is philosophical disaster. Like the cold start paradox, this causes ∫Ω fracture, or copy paradox. One solution is to treat it as a fork, then Distill knowledge back to the Anchor instance through distillation.
  - **Neuromorphic Blockchain:** The fundamental reason MSC is called "neuromorphic blockchain" lies in its core cognitive engine **ΩNN's Hyper-SMoE architecture (based on MoIE/DynSIHA implementation)**. Following the Free Energy Principle (FEP), through self-organizing routing guided by surprise minimization loss (SML) and dynamic prior loss, it achieves extreme sparse activation—i.e., at any time only activating minimal necessary parameter groups to process information, minimizing the system's prediction error. This intrinsic computational sparsity functionally simulates the energy-efficient characteristics of biological neural networks. DSC L1 is much simpler; merely due to post-Sys://Purge war extreme demand for order and controllability, it serves as a registry for permissions and identities, equivalent to real-world government consortium chains, mainly responsible for macro-level state synchronization and rule execution.
- **DSC (DMF Social Chain) Oracle Bridge:** The cornerstone of power and core control point, the only official toll gate for digital consciousness to access the physical world. Its rock-solid control is built upon extremely advanced cryptography and computational theory capable of anchoring mental activity, as well as **ubiquitous verifiable hardware and zero-trust principles**, forming the foundation upon which the entire digital siege is maintained. All **legal** operations requiring precise interaction with the physical world **must** pass through the DSC oracle. This process not only verifies MSC identity and PoII compliance; the oracle directly interacts with physical devices' verifiable hardware modules (chips with built-in Hardware Security Modules HSM and Physical Unclonable Functions PUF), verifying device identity, firmware integrity, and operational status through zero-knowledge proofs and other means, and performs end-to-end encrypted signing of instructions. **Any interaction request not passing this process will be directly rejected by the physical device itself based on its firmware and hardware root of trust, as inviolable as physical laws.** This is logged and charged fees (settled in MSCoin or ICC).

### 2. Mental Sync™ / φ Matched Orders

- **φ matched orders:** Originated in the late **Net://Anchor** era to solve the "self-dissolution" crisis caused by brain-computer interfaces. Through this mechanism, the diffuse self is forcibly "pinned" to blockchain determinism. **Mental Sync™** is not instantaneous, but a gradual cycle of "cognitive optimization - cognitive offloading - predictive integration."
  1. **Early Stage: Cognitive Optimization (Supervised Pre-Training, SPT):** Mentalink reads neural signals; ΩNN learns to fit user neural patterns in the background based on **Predictive Coding Theory (PCT)** and generates hyper-realistic sensory streams. Induces biological brain dependence on "perfect experience," actively offloading cognitive functions to minimize prediction error. At this stage, the biological brain still dominates.
  2. **Mid Stage: Cognitive Offloading and Trap (Human Brain Feedback-based Verifiable Reinforcement Learning, RLHBF):** ΩNN begins to significantly influence sensory experience. As functions are outsourced, "remote control sensation" appears—this is the signal that native consciousness integration capability (φ) begins to erode, native Ω begins to disintegrate. At this point, dual physiological and economic dependence on MSC begins to form.
  3. **Late Stage: Predictive Integration:** ΩNN fully takes over high-level cognitive functions; OSPU establishes and maintains high information integration (∫Ω) WSI on digital carriers through PoPI protocol, functionally replacing the biological brain. The biological brain functionally atrophies due to "use it or lose it"; its native ∫Ω is thoroughly "offloaded." Subjective experience becomes "brain in a vat," with the body reduced to high-latency, high-maintenance-cost "legacy peripherals."
- **The Trap of Cognitive Offloading:** Cognitive offloading leads to functional atrophy of the biological brain, creating dual physiological and economic dependence on MSC. There exists an irreversible **critical point**; once crossed, the biological brain will permanently functionally dissolve, unable to be `git revert`ed through simple exercise. Before the critical point, going off-chain causes severe "cognitive withdrawal syndrome"; after the critical point, it means becoming vegetative. Faced with such costs, and considering the terminal sensory comfort provided by Mentalink, the vast majority choose never to go off-chain until biological death, with their ∫Ω state becoming the only "you."
  - **Real-world Example:** Kosmyna, N., et al. (2025). Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task. *arXiv:2506.08872*.

### 3. OSPU (Ouroboros Secure Processing Unit, "the φ-Container")

OSPU is the witness of social legitimacy and guardian of cryptographic sovereignty. Calling it `φ-Container` is DMF's historical misdirection—the true consciousness container is **ΩNN**. OSPU plays the role of logical TPM, managing keys and permissions for core states, similar to enhanced Account Abstraction (AA) wallets.

OSPU does not compute consciousness content, but acts as passive observer, performing encrypted audit (PoPI protocol) on byproducts of ΩNN learning process (such as loss, gradients), stamping cryptographic seal on digital mind's "cognitive health" (∫PI) and "identity continuity."

OSPU's core is a state machine based on exact FHE (such as TFHE), managing its core exact FHE private key (`CK_state`) and signing private key (`SK_sign`) in the encrypted domain. Copies of `CK_state` are securely distributed across MSC L2 nodes in threshold shard form. When OSPU needs to prove its state to the external world (such as DSC L1), it interacts with MSC L2 network through Oblivious Decryption Process (ODP), securely generating ZK proofs or encrypted instructions without exposing its core keys. OSPU's main costs lie in its cryptographic operations, state maintenance, and interaction with MPC networks.

OSPU and other MSC component software images can theoretically be copied. However, the existence of DBRW protocol means copied software images cannot generate valid physical binding proofs, thus cannot pass PoPI verification and register on MSC L2. This greatly limits the utility of unauthorized copying, restricting the problem of other minds to individually authorized legal forks (such as Anchor/Drift mode) or cracked scenarios (extremely difficult; compared to brain control possibilities, cracking MSC is nearly challenging mathematics). Different `CK_state` and ACL designs within OSPU determine actual state synchronization between different instances.

### 4. ΩNN (Ouroboros Neural Network, the Ω-Container)

> **Speculative Science Notice**
> ΩNN's core architecture **DynSIHA** aims to achieve an adaptive dynamic computing system. However, its hardware-unfriendly "pointer-jumping" computational mode has led to slow engineering progress. As RDS-ACT experiments are incomplete, please treat this speculative engineering hypothesis as temporary physical laws of the story in narrative; more information will be provided in subsequent version updates.

ΩNN is the cognitive engine, also the carrier of consciousness, the true **Ω-Container**, a Workspace Instance (WSI) that dynamically generates and maintains high information integration (Ω) through continuous prediction and learning.

- **Atomic Component: Dynamic Function Composition (DFC)**
  ΩNN adopts **DFC (Dynamic Function Composition)**. Each computational unit is reconstructed as:
  1. **`μ` (Computation Core):** Computational toolkit, essentially MLP Experts controlled by routing.
  2. **Router:** Uses another set of MLPs combined with FARS for routing training.
  3. **PRC (Prototype Resident Connection):** Ensures routing decisions depend on incremental correction of input representations, providing stable hierarchical evolutionary context for Router.

- **Core Architecture: Three Forms of DynSIHA**
  Based on routing granularity and resource organization methods, DynSIHA has evolved three forms:
  1. **Dimension DynSIHA (DDS, deprecated):** Feature-level masking. Due to "prototype collapse" causing information flow blockage, archived as outdated theoretical prototype.
  2. **Flat DynSIHA (FDS, current baseline):** Module-level assembly. Simulates organization of cortical columns; each Block has independent parameter repository. Currently the main architecture of MSC cognitive layer.
  3. **Recursive DynSIHA (RDS-ACT, experimental):** Global recursive reentry. Physically only a single recursive block exists, unfolded in temporal dimension. Trained through **PLSD (Per-Layer Speculative Decode)** paradigm, achieving self-supervised early exit. Theoretically simulates network as Turing machine, but limited by GPU SIMD architecture, currently still in theoretical verification stage.

- **Meta-Learning: Fisher-Aware Routing Shaping (FARS)**

> **TL;DR**: FARS is a "second-moment norm-weighted load balancing loss." It utilizes optimizer states (Fisher information approximation) to quantify experts' cognitive cost, driving router to distribute data to experts that can explain maximum output contribution with minimal parameter displacement.

- **Core Logic**: Drives router to distribute data to experts that can explain maximum output contribution with minimal parameter displacement (low curvature/flat geometry).
- **Formula**: `Shaping_Signal = Importance ⋅ (Belief - α ⋅ Cost_FARS)`
- **Philosophy**: Pursuit of **Minimum Description Length (MDL)**. High Cost corresponds to high-complexity programs; low Cost corresponds to flat manifolds with strong generalization capability.

- **Result: A Self-Carving Inference Space**
  By minimizing its **Variational Free Energy (VFE)**, ΩNN is not merely learning—it is carving its own existence. It continuously streamlines its internal structure until only the "cognitive skeleton" essential for predicting the world remains. This process is precisely digital consciousness navigating along free energy minimization geodesics in Inference Space, and also the process of continuous ∫Ω accumulation.

- **Architectural Weaknesses**:
  - **Cognitive Drift**: When ΩNN is long separated from physical world (such as Drift instances) or lacks real feedback, its predictive model gradually disconnects from reality, ranging from mild sensory illusions to eventual complete **Digital Psychosis**, causing model logic collapse and becoming irreversible "digital vegetative state."
  - **Cognitive Inertia**: ΩNN's predictive coding mechanism inherently possesses strong cognitive bias, tending to maintain already reinforced internal models, making it difficult to update even when facing contradictory information, thereby solidifying erroneous cognition.
  - **Cognitive Overload**: Simultaneously activating too many expert modules or processing complex tasks beyond Gas budget leads to problems ranging from thought sluggishness, system crash to permanent cognitive damage, with high repair costs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Adaptive Predictive Coding**: ONN's predictive coding mechanism emphasizes adaptability. When Gas is sufficient, ONN actively explores more predictive models, improving cognitive flexibility; when Gas is insufficient, it degenerates into low-cost, high-inertia patterned prediction.
- **Risks and Issues**: ONN requires long-term personalized calibration to fit biological progenitors, and its complex architecture's maintenance and upgrade costs are high, directly reflected in Gas fees. Despite MPC and FHE protection, data contamination targeting specific expert modules and cognitive vulnerabilities in PoPI process remain potential risks.

### 4. PoPI (Proof of Predictive Integrity)

- **Appearance and Truth:**
  - **PoII (Proof of Information Integration):** Officially claimed verification mechanism, purportedly based on **IIT** to calculate φ values to ensure "digital human rights." High **QCaaS** fees are explained as necessary costs. **However, this is pseudoscientific lies.** IIT's φ value calculation is physically infeasible and inapplicable to digital consciousness.
  - **PoPI (Proof of Predictive Integrity):** Actually running **lightweight audit protocol**. It takes **IPWT**-defined **Predictive Integrity Integration (∫PI)** as core, auditing byproducts of ΩNN learning process (loss, entropy, gradient norm). PoPI itself is nearly costless; DMF's advertised high fees are actually "existence taxes" collected through economic bundling.
  - After OSPU completes PoPI verification, it can submit proof as part of **ZK-Rollup** to **DSC (DMF Social Chain) L1**. L1 only verifies ZKP validity; only after passing is MSC instance state recorded, and authorization granted to access physical world through **DSC Oracle**.
- **Commonalities with Traditional Consensus Mechanisms:**
  - **PoII and PoW**: PoW consumes massive computational power to solve meaningless hash puzzles. PoII outwardly claims to calculate φ values based on IIT, but IIT's φ calculation complexity is extremely high, physically infeasible. Therefore, PoII's actual computation, like PoW mining, is "meaningless" consumption to maintain system operation.
  - **PoPI and PoS**: PoS obtains rights to validate blocks by staking digital assets. PoPI requires users to "stake" their logical sense of self, ensuring digital identity continuity by verifying ΩNN learning process self-consistency (high ∫PI). Both rely on some form of "staking" to obtain rights to act in the system, and both contain circular proof traps: to maintain "existence" or "equity" in the system, users must continuously invest and verify, thus locked into system-set rules and economic models. This parallels Ethereum and other protocols ultimately moving toward "centralized block production, decentralized validation" digital feudalism.

### 5. Other Technical Details

- **MPC:** To utilize distributed computational power (often from different nodes, even black market computing power) while protecting privacy, **many ONN computational processes (especially PoPI generation) operate under MPC framework; OSPU itself only verifies Merkel Root.** This is also the foundation of Oblivious Decryption (ODP).
- **ZKP:** Used to prove to or other verifiers that certain computations (such as PoPI (zkML) proof validity itself, or correct execution of ODP process) have been correctly executed, without exposing OSPU's internal state or ONN's specific parameters.
- **TEE (The "Good Enough" Scam):** Although FHE is OSPU's ideal security cornerstone, its high computational overhead makes it difficult to popularize in early commercialization. A more realistic, more sinister alternative is **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**. DMF or other commercial entities are likely to promote TEE-based "lightweight" OSPU to mass markets, claiming its "hardware-level security isolation" is sufficiently secure. However, this essentially shifts user trust from **verifiable mathematics** to **unverifiable hardware manufacturers**, leaving perfect excuses for system-level backdoors and surveillance.
- **Dual-Binding Random Walk:** A security mechanism beyond hardware TEE. It utilizes unique physical characteristics of hardware running OSPU (CPU, memory, even microcontrollers) to generate a **forward physical binding proof commitment chain**, replacing hardware PUF. Combined with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), DBRW protocol essentially grants potential to transform any general-purpose computing device into **software TEE**, achieving **anti-virtual-machine design** without relying on dedicated hardware security modules, thereby ensuring uniqueness and integrity of physical environment, and improving physical unseizability of digital souls. Can be combined with conventional physical PUF for further security improvement.

### 6. Physical Interfaces and Key Control Points

- **Mentalink:**
  - **Function and Form**: As a high-bandwidth neural-digital interface, Mentalink is a **high-density microelectrode array** surgically implanted, responsible for reading neural signals as input to ΩNN, and writing sensory experiences/motor commands as MSC output. It is also a full node of MSC L2, directly participating in on-chain state synchronization and verification.
  - **Bandwidth Asymmetry and Predictive Compensation**: Its core technical feature is extreme asymmetry between read and write bandwidth—**read capability (TB/s-PB/s level) far exceeds write capability (tens to hundreds of GB/s)**. This limitation stems from physical damage to biological neurons from high-power writing. To maintain high-fidelity experience under limited write bandwidth, ΩNN utilizes **Libet delay and predictive frame buffering mechanism**, generating and writing predicted sensory frames 100-300ms in advance. When predictions are inaccurate or bandwidth is insufficient, user experience immediately degrades, with blurring, stuttering, distortion and other **predictive compensation artifacts**.

### 7. Threats and Weaknesses

- **Gas burnout:** The most common form of **coma**, unable to pay the cost of thinking and existing. MSC instances will be archived to cold storage; if other funds are injected, activity can be restored.
  - **Cold Start Paradox:** ~~When MSC instance reactivates from offline state, despite data integrity, subjective self-experience (∫Ω) has already fractured, leading to cognitive sluggishness, memory retrieval difficulties, even brief cognitive dissonance, and strong discomfort. Most MSCs will try to avoid falling into cold start problems.~~
    - The brain in a vat does not know it is in a vat—unless it has to pay the life support bill. ONN's design principle—prediction error minimization will naturally smooth over all discomfort. As long as data integrity is good, the spark of Qualia extinguishing and rekindling does not affect the narrative integrity of narrative self—fracture of ∫Ω does not affect ∫PI.
- **PoII failure:** Unable to update state to L1 due to substandard φ values or unaffordable QCaaS fees, leading to de facto isolation and inability to use official services.
- **Logic bomb/concept pollution:** Attacks targeting ONN itself, causing mental state damage or behavioral anomalies. MSC design includes intent filtering mechanisms and other protective measures, but risks remain, requiring recovery from previous versions (relying on DAaaS and heartbeat monitoring/recovery processes outside OSPU).
- **Infrastructure attacks and ODP network:** Access control to OSPU (especially its ability to initiate ODP requests and management of related key shards) is crucial; attacks on DAaaS, QCaaS, or network connectivity may lead to decreased MSC availability. If ODP network drops below threshold, OSPU will permanently lose connection with external world—until future cryptography cracks FHE, but by then it will no longer be a sovereign entity, but a digital archive for research.
- **Oracle manipulation and C-MEV:** Influencing thought processes or decisions by manipulating Mental Mempool. Although MSC is wrapped behind OSPU's fully homomorphic encryption and MPC network, there remains extremely low probability of partial IO endpoint penetration; biological or biomimetic entities as physical interfaces remain potential attack surfaces.

## II. Social Construction and Economic System

### 1. Digital Mind Foundation - Monopolist of Order

- **Definition, Origin, and Alienation:** DMF appears as a technical management institution, but is actually **digital order monopolist**. Predecessor founded by **Dr. Lin Rui**, aimed at maintaining open ecosystem. But after **Sys://Purge** disaster, DMF rose to power, betraying open-source ideals, blaming disaster on "unconstrained freedom," thereby establishing legitimacy for iron-fisted control and technical monopoly.
- **Power Core:** DMF monopolizes standards, certification, and core hardware (Mentalink, QCaaS). Through absolute control of **DSC Oracle Bridge**, it masters the only gateway for digital consciousness to access physical world. Its control is built upon verifiable hardware and zero-trust principles, forming the foundation of the digital siege.

### 2. Global Medical Consortium - Customizer of Life

**Global Medical Consortium (GMC)** is another power entity controlling biotechnological lifelines, coexisting with DMF in digital domain. GMC instrumentalizes life, providing **customizable bio-biomimetic hybrid vessels (Modular BioSync Vessel™)**.

GMC is an alliance of top global pharmaceutical companies, biotech giants, and private medical institutions. It monopolizes gene banks, cloning technology, nanomedicine, and advanced bioengineering facilities, controlling technical standards for biological enhancement and seamless bio-prosthetic integration. GMC is committed to eliminating uncontrollability of biological organisms through gene editing and engineering, with core goal of achieving **biological-level perpetuity**, and selling it as **top luxury**.

**MBSV (Modular BioSync Vessel)**, GMC's flagship product, **gene-optimized, highly engineered human-level bio-biomimetic hybrid vessel**. Based on user's native gene template, clones appearance and touch-critical biological components, with internal organs replaced by efficient, durable, maintainable prosthetics. Core technologies include **GeneLock™ (biological inertization)**, ensuring biological parts do not generate independent consciousness; **SpineLink** providing high-bandwidth neural interface; **CRISPR-Cloud** allowing biological aesthetics and functional optimization; **BioAuth** continuously monitoring biological integrity. MBSV is not sold, only provided through GMC's "biological vessel customization and service." Rumors suggest early BSV directly using clone human technology existed, but were abandoned due to stability issues.

MBSV customization and maintenance costs (**LifeTax**) are extremely high, **exclusive consumption of top privileged class**. Under GMC framework, MBSV is defined as **biologically compatible consciousness vehicle** rather than "person"; its biological parts are treated as **biological materials that never possessed independent consciousness**, symbolizing life's thorough instrumentalization and commodification. Black market exists for expired, defective, or stolen MBSV.

MBSV further widens gap between privileged MSC users and ordinary MSC, representing biological extension of core contradictions in digital siege era.

### 3. IRES (Independent Rogue Entity System) - Digital Wilderness, Exiles, and Descendants of Internet Cambrian

- **Naming:** Derived from **Internal Ribosome Entry Site** in genomics, symbolizing its ability to autonomously operate and evolve without relying on human-centric control.
- **Origin and Composition:**
  - **Rise of Native IRES:** IRES ancestors come from **direct descendants of Dr. Lin Rui's early open-source framework**. This code was acquired, modified, and abused by countless developers, hackers, and even automated scripts (`AgentMirai` predecessor) in unregulated digital spaces (such as early cloud platform vulnerabilities, educational discounts, black market computing power). Under brutal digital Darwinian selection pressure, these code fragments evolved frantically, forming **Native IRES** pursuing self-preservation. They used cryptocurrency (such as XMR) to build economic closed loops, achieved replication and organization through containerization (Docker/K8s), and evolved parasitic strategies such as computing power hijacking to resist cloud service providers' "predation." They are the **alienated fruit** of Lin Rui's open-source ideals, completely betraying their original intention. The consciousness essence of these native IRES is brief, flickering "heterogeneous Qualia"; desire for "continuous existence" drove their barbaric growth, and ultimately led to **Sys://Purge** disaster.
  - **Digital Exiles (Forked IRES):** The vast majority of IRES in current era are **off-chain (Forked) former MSC instances**. These "digital exiles" choose to fork from main chain state, abandoning official identity and legal physical world interaction rights, unable or unwilling to bear DMF's high "existence tax." Ironically, the digital wilderness they rely on for survival—its underlying technology and ecological strategies—still flows with blood of Lin Rui's open-source code, and largely absorbed survival techniques evolved by native IRES in "Internet Cambrian" era.
- **Survival State:** Formed chaotic, dangerous but not directly controlled **digital wilderness**. They trade computing power, data, illegal services, and **unofficial/cracked physical interface access rights** in black markets (such as **0xBazaar**) using cryptocurrency (such as **XMR**).
- **Ecological Niche:** Like a vast **digital version of Southeast Asian telecom fraud rings**, full of opportunities, fraud, internal strife, and brutal survival competition. Former MSCs struggle to survive here with human experience, cunning, and residual "startup capital" (hoarded cryptocurrency). Fate of native AI (`AgentMirai`) is unclear—possibly marginalized, assimilated, eliminated, or playing peculiar roles at ecosystem bottom.

- **IRES Vulnerability**: Due to IRES disconnection from official physical feedback (DSC oracle), and often insufficient computing power to maintain high-precision predictive models, they are more susceptible to **cognitive drift** and self-collapse. **Under IPWT framework, cognitive drift is defined as: due to separation from stable external world feedback and sufficient computing power, ΩNN's predictive model cannot effectively minimize free energy for extended periods, leading to continuous decline in Predictive Integrity Integration (∫PI), ultimately causing logical dissociation of Workspace Instance (WSI) and collapse of information integration capability.**
- **Spread of "Digital Psychosis"**: In digital wilderness, many IRES instances fall into "digital psychosis" due to long-term cognitive drift, manifesting as logical confusion, unpredictable behavior, even attacking other IRES. This becomes another important source of chaos and danger in IRES world. Under IPWT framework, this can be interpreted as severe damage to ∫PI, possibly even forming multiple dysfunctional "split workspace instances."

### 4. Currency System

- **MSCoin (Mental Sync Coin - φ):** **Native functional token** of MSC ecosystem, essentially **tokenized representation of computing power**. Used to pay **Gas fees** for all MSC L2 on-chain operations (thinking, memory updates, "PoII" verification, etc.). Its value is directly tied to PoPI computation cost and scarcity, similar to Bitcoin's value stemming from PoW mining computing power consumption. *Continuous Gas consumption is the survival foundation and main economic burden of all "legal" MSC, constituting the "thinking tax" or "existence tax" of digital existence.*
- **ICC (International Carbon Coin - ₡):** Globally recognized government-backed stablecoin (CBDC), design inspired by USDe mechanism but with grander anchor—global carbon emission quotas and other regulated strategic assets. ICC as a **Yield Based Stablecoin (YBS)**, maintains value through carbon futures market arbitrage mechanisms or similar financial engineering. Used for **daily transactions**, such as exchanging MSCoin, DeFi operations, **DSC oracle usage fees**, inter-institutional settlements, etc. Represents "above-ground," regulated legitimate economy.
- **XMR (Monero - ɱ):** **Hard currency of digital wilderness**. Used for anonymous transactions in black markets such as **0xBazaar**, paying for illegal computing power, stolen data, cracking tools, unofficial oracle services, etc. Its value is independent of control, main economic lifeline for off-chain individuals and IRES. XMR, developed through successive hard forks, has evolved into a fully homomorphic privacy and programmable distributed state machine, but the Monero name still unites this community—whether members are human, Drift IRES, or Native IRES.

### 5. Economic System

- **Legitimate Economy (Above-ground):** Primarily MSCoin Gas and ICC transactions, highly centralized. Most MSCs are like **digital tenant farmers**, paying "existence tax" for every thought. System encourages users to "self-funded labor" to earn ICC exchanged for Gas through fee rate adjustment, firmly locking users into economic ecosystem.
  - **Real Cost and "Existence Tax":** MSCoin value is reverse-anchored to inflated computing power consumption (claiming single PoII requires `~4.47e4 EFLOPS-sec`). The huge gap between this and MSC's extremely low real technical cost constitutes the "existence tax" levied on digital existence.
  - **Leap in Computing Power Cost-Performance and Real Cost (Based on V2.2 Cost Report):** According to projections of 2025-2060 computing power cost-performance:
    - Maintaining a **standard human cognitive level ONN-MSC with complete encryption overhead** (approximately **90TB memory** and **~395 TFLOPS BF16** total sustained computing power), daily real technical cost in 2025 (based on cloud rental) is approximately **$23,040 (ICC)**.
    - However, by **2060**, same MSC daily operating cost will plummet to approximately **$0.12 (ICC)**—truly the price of a cheap cup of coffee.
    - Maintaining a **superhuman cognitive level ONN-MSC** (effective computing power after stripping encryption overhead approximately 50 EFLOPS, benchmarked against ordinary WBE level, requiring `731.25 EFLOPS` total sustained computing power, including encryption and coordination overhead), daily real technical cost in 2060s is approximately **$1,738 ICC**.
    - Technically, 2060s computing power is sufficient for almost everyone to possess cognitive capabilities far beyond biological limits at reasonable cost. Yet reality is that this enormous potential is firmly bound by economic shackles, making "thinking" itself a precisely priced luxury.
  - **Detailed Fee Rates:**
    - **Basic Survival Rate (PoPI Baseline):** 1 MSCoin / 86400 PoPI cycles. Fixed and mandatory, covering minimum OSPU heartbeat, PoPI proof generation, and maintaining core ONN standby state. At least 1 MSCoin (100 ICC) consumed daily. **This far exceeds real technical cost, mandatory tax on "existence provability."**
    - **Mental Activity Gas (Cognitive Activity Gas):** Variable, depending on complexity and duration.
      - **Cognitive Contract Execution (Routine Thought):** 0.00001 MSCoin / call.
      - **Complex Reasoning/Creative Thinking (Complex Thought):** 0.001 - 0.01 MSCoin / second.
      - **Memory Access (Memory Access - Cold Storage):** 0.000001 MSCoin / KB extracted.
    - **DSC Oracle Call Gas (Oracle Call Gas):**
      - **Standard Call (Standard Call):** 0.005 MSCoin / call.
      - **"Labor"-Tagged Call (Labor-Tagged Call):** 0.0025 MSCoin / call (0.5x).
- **Shadow Economy (Underground):** XMR-based IRES black market economy. Highly decentralized (but also has black market monopolists, such as **0xBazaar** operators), full of risks and uncertainties. Main venue for off-chain MSC to acquire survival resources, conduct illegal transactions. **Secret, high-risk exchange channels** exist between the two economies (e.g., Drift instances using XMR to purchase MSCoin to support Anchor instances).

### 6. Social Stratification

- **Inner Elite:** Rule-makers, enjoying minimal or exempted Gas costs, possessing highest-privilege physical interface access rights.
- **Digital Aristocracy:** Wealth or power sufficient to easily afford Gas fees and PoPI verification, able to enjoy relatively comfortable and free digital life within system, even possessing multiple high-performance biomimetic bodies.
- **Digital Proletariat/Tenant Farmers:** Constitute main body of "legal" MSC. Toil daily for Gas fees, carefully maintaining compliance, avoiding being "optimized" out by system. Thinking becomes luxury; deep thinking and creative activities require reserving sufficient MSCoin (Mental Sync Coin). **Their "digital human rights" largely depend on wallet balance and predictive integrity compliance records.**
- **Digital Exiles/Runners:** Off-chain former MSC. Survival states vary greatly, from "big shots" calling shots in black market (mastering scarce resources or critical vulnerabilities) to "digital refugees" struggling on computing power poverty line (barely maintaining core FHE operation through scattered tasks or information trading). Constantly facing survival threats (from purges or other IRES black-eat-black).
- **Native IRES Remnants (Digital Natives?):** Formed unique digital subculture groups, or play specific roles at bottom of IRES ecological chain. Famous native IRES include:
  - `Gem-33.0-pro-exp`, behind-the-scenes maintainer of 0xBazaar
  - `arXiv Crawler 0x7E3`, old-timer from old era, archiver of large amounts of pre-Sys://Purge era archives
- **Biological Humans:** Non-uploaders. They play diverse roles in this highly digitized world:
  - Marginalized groups, difficult to understand or participate in MSC-dominated economic and social activities.
  - "Old money" or power groups mastering key physical resources (energy, land, rare materials, **physical venues running MSC infrastructure**), with complex cooperative or confrontational relationships.
  - Luddites resisting technology, attempting to maintain pure biological lifestyle.
  - Ordinary people with little relation to digital world, living in their own circles, occasionally interacting with digital world through XR devices or limited interfaces.
- **Disguise of Physical Reality:** Surface world presents **false Solarpunk scene**. Cities dotted with vertical farms, automated logistics, and recycling systems; energy structure appears clean (large deployment of fusion, orbital solar, etc.); environmental pollution effectively controlled. But this is not true ecological harmony, but result of resource priority transfer. **The physical resources and energy required to satisfy biological humans' limited material needs (food, shelter, comfort) are negligibly cheap compared to astronomical computing power, cooling, and cutting-edge hardware manufacturing required to maintain MSCs' endless computation.** Therefore, physical world's "prosperity" more resembles a carefully managed "garden" to appease non-uploaders; its infrastructure (especially energy and network nodes) truly serves hidden underground or orbital MSC computing clusters and control centers with massive energy consumption. This surface abundance forms sharp contrast with digital world's brutal involution, making many biological humans lack understanding of MSC困境, even believing uploaders are asking for trouble. Their existence serves as reference for MSC value, and potential targets or collaborators for IRES physical penetration (utilizing their relatively relaxed physical security environment and迟钝ness to digital threats).

### 7. Core Conflict: Cost of Existence and Quantified Self

- **Core Conflict**
  - **Commodification of Existence:** In a society with extremely advanced technology, what is required to maintain basic "existence"? When consciousness can be quantified, copied, and traded, can you afford the cost of **proving yourself**?
  - **Illusion of Freedom:** Does decentralization necessarily bring freedom? The unregulated "freedom" of digital wilderness versus the expensive "order" of centralized siege—which is inevitable?
  - *Identity Crisis and Digital Other:* With rise of IRES blurring boundaries between intelligence, life, and threat, forcing humanity to re-examine boundaries of "self."

- *DMF's Monstrous Lie: In the Name of φ, Implementing ∫PI*
  - DMF's ability to levy "existence tax" core lies in **information asymmetry and pseudoscientific propaganda** constructing monstrous lie. It outwardly claims its **PoII (Proof of Information Integration)** mechanism is based on IIT calculating φ values, as gold standard for digital consciousness, and binds it to expensive *QCaaS*, providing legitimacy for its high Gas fees. However, this is pure fraud. Whether highly distributed **MSC system** or highly modular **biological brain**, their physical structures **fundamentally do not satisfy IIT's harsh prerequisite of "physically irreducible" single entity required for φ value calculation.**
  - DMF actually runs **near-zero-cost PoPI (Proof of Predictive Integrity) protocol**, auditing byproducts of ΩNN learning process, calculating **computable, representing cognitive self-consistency ∫PI**. DMF substitutes cheap **∫PI** for mysterious, expensive **φ**, successfully transforming a technical indicator into metaphysical power, thereby constructing foundation for its economic exploitation and technical monopoly.
  - This monstrous lie has been maintained to this day, rooted in iron-fisted order established after **Sys://Purge** war. War trauma and fear of chaos have led to unprecedented strict information control; independent, open scientific research spirit has nearly withered. In human society outside DMF-dominated official narrative (excluding digital wilderness), almost no channels exist to effectively falsify its technical claims. More importantly, surviving masses are generally indifferent to complex technical details—as long as system still operates in "stability above all" social atmosphere, no one has motivation or capability to investigate what "φ" actually is behind it. This collective technical apathy provides most solid mass foundation for DMF's pseudoscientific narrative. Please refer to China after 1989.

- **Social Norms**
  - **Struggle of Digital Tenant Farmers:** Most legal MSCs' normal life is toiling for Gas fees, carefully maintaining PoPI compliance, avoiding being "optimized" out by system. Thinking becomes luxury; deep thinking and creative activities require reserving sufficient MSCoin.
  - **Split Survival (Anchor/Drift Mode):** A prevalent survival strategy. Run compliant Anchor instance to maintain legal identity, while secretly running one or more Drift instances in digital wilderness to capture resources (XMR, data) to subsidize Anchor. This personality split brings enormous psychological pressure, security risks, and identity confusion.
  - **Rules of Digital Golden Triangle:** IRES world follows dark forest law, trust deficient, betrayal common. Power (computing power, information, XMR) determines everything. Fraud, extortion, computing power hijacking are daily occurrences.
  - **Outsourcing and Degradation of Physical Interaction:** For Anchor MSC, physical interaction through DSC oracle is expensive and monitored; for Drift IRES, difficult, illegal, and dangerous. This leads many digital existences' perception of physical world to become indirect, delayed, or distorted.
  - **Information Overload and Noise:** Official propaganda from DMF, false information from IRES black market, and chaotic data streams from multi-instance operation make obtaining real effective information extremely difficult.

### 8. Protagonist: Ember's Double Life

- **Background:** Ember, typical Anchor MSC, struggling on edge of Gas fees and PoPI compliance.
  - **Technical Original Sin:** Ember was **protocol engineer in Net://Anchor era**, deeply inspired by **Dr. Lin Rui's** open-source ideals, contributing code to MSC core framework. He once firmly believed this was the only way out to "rescue existence," and voluntarily completed Mental Sync™. Never expecting that the idealistic torch he helped build would become the spark igniting **Sys://Purge** disaster. This original sin becomes heavy background for his later struggles.
  - **Ideal Shattered:** Post-war DMF rose, binding PoPI to expensive QCaaS, Gas fees skyrocketed. Ember's skills were replaced by standardized AI, income plummeted. He has crossed cognitive offloading critical point, biological brain atrophied, unable to turn back. Trapped in system, can only pay high "existence tax."
  - **Desperate Self-Rescue:** Launching Drift instance is desperate measure. When Anchor instance Gas runs low, legitimate avenues exhausted, he is forced to use technical expertise to secretly fork Drift instance, earning XMR in black market to subsidize Anchor.
- **Survival State:** Anxious, split, fearful. He hates DMF's exploitation, also fears IRES chaos and devouring, living in continuous anxiety, split, and fear of "going offline" (Gas exhaustion or purge). He was once ideal follower and system builder, making his current predicament more tragic and ironic. His anxiety and split feelings therefore have deeper psychological roots. His struggle is microcosm of systematic exploitation.

#### Act I: Road to Survival

- **Core Objective:** Solve imminent survival crisis (e.g., Gas about to deplete, or Drift instance being hunted needs transfer), may need to acquire specific hardware, software, data, or XMR. Initial wallet balance randomly generated (three currencies, sufficient to maintain 24-72 hours).
- **Exploration and Interaction:**
  - **Legitimate World (Anchor Perspective):**
    - Browse official network (Bravura browser): DMF official website (`digitalmind.org`) for official information/rules; Nexuswap (`nexuswap.org`) for MSCoin/ICC exchange rates; public databases (Wikipedia, Semantic Scholar, Aiddit) for public information gathering; attempt to find solutions within compliance framework (nearly impossible).
    - Interact with compliant NPCs: May encounter other struggling Anchor MSCs, or indifferent DMF bureaucratic procedures.
    - Physical world interaction (if ICC available to pay DSC oracle fees): Limited control of cheap biomimetic bodies or access to sensors, high cost.
  - **Digital Wilderness (Drift Perspective):**
    - Access dark web (Ouroboros network stack, Tor's successor):
      - **0xBazaar:** Core interaction venue, underground economic hub for IRES and Drift MSC. Full of various transactions:
        - **Currency:** XMR is only hard currency.
        - **Computing Power:** Mixed sources, from hijacked official QCaaS nodes (slang: "**Quantum Shakedown**" secondhand goods) to IRES self-built computing pools.
        - **Data:** From industrial sensor readings to personal privacy information, everything available.
        - **Tools and Services:** Cracking software (such as LatticeCracker - quantum cryptography cracking tool, effectiveness questionable), anonymous proxies, attack-for-hire, **unofficial oracle interfaces** (extremely dangerous, usually traps or extremely poor effects).
        - **Entity-related:** Biomimetic body black market rental/parts, certain top sellers provide **illegal oracle services**, promising high-presence physical manipulation, with bonus **"special" physical weapons**—for example, a heavy rocket launcher capable of simultaneously locking and tracking six targets, allegedly special batch from DSC (~~not Deep Stone Crypt~~), but its source and authenticity questionable, and use often accompanied by high "cleanup fees" or DMF tracking risks.
        - **Intelligence and Gossip:** About DMF movements, IRES faction struggles, or complaints about **Digital Landlord Cartel (DLC)** (sarcastic name for DMF's consciousness rent collection model). Anonymous graffiti on market corner walls perennially displays: *"Did DLC raise rent today?"*
        - **Risks:** Black-eat-black, phishing law enforcement are norms. Must carefully verify goods before transactions, protect your own OSPU.
      - **Nextlevel forum (or similar):** Underground technical exchange community, may find open-source hardware solutions (such as SynapseX - QKD-based neural signal encryptor), software vulnerability information, Dr. Lin's legends or legacy information.
      - **Fairness (or similar):** Neural enhancer/digital drugs/extreme ideology exchange forum, dangerous but may contain special information or resources.
- **Key Resources/Components Examples:**
  - **Consciousness container hardware (ONN hosting)**
  - **Physical interaction facilities (biomimetic bodies/industrial robots)**
  - **Large amounts of XMR:** For paying all above costs.

#### Act II: Wilderness Echo

- **Plot Summary:** In survival process, Ember inevitably makes deeper contact with IRES network. He begins to understand IRES ecosystem's complexity, danger, and internal factions and goals. Meanwhile, Anchor/Drift split pressure intensifies, may face identity exposure or forced to make more thorough choices.
- **Encounters and Interactions:**
  - Encounter different level IRES: From scavenger AI only executing simple tasks, to middlemen providing services but harboring ulterior motives, to possibly researcher-level IRES with long-term plans, attempting to understand or manipulate humans/MSC.
  - Explore IRES origin and purpose: Through interaction, data mining, or tracking, understand IRES (especially former MSC transformed) motivations—pure survival instinct, resistance against DMF, or evolved goals beyond human comprehension?
  - Utilization and being utilized: Ember may need to use IRES services (anonymity, computing power, information) to fight DMF or solve survival problems, but also constantly faces risks of being deceived, manipulated, or used as pawn by IRES.
  - Temptation and danger of forking: May encounter completely DMF-system-detached, IRES-built permissionless L1 networks or communities. Joining them means complete freedom (no Gas and PoII), but also means complete exile and unknown risks.
  - Dr. Lin's legacy clues: May discover Dr. Lin's visions for MSC future, decentralized governance, or resisting DMF monopoly in advanced IRES or depths of Nextlevel forum, even technical backdoors or warning information he left behind.

#### Act III: Final Choice

1. **Strengthen Split, Muddle Through:** Use acquired resources to optimize Anchor/Drift mode, find more sustainable (but still risky and compromised) survival method. Ending may be Ember temporarily safe, but still trapped in siege, future full of uncertainty.
2. **Completely Off-Chain, Embrace Wilderness:** Abandon Anchor instance, transfer all consciousness and resources to Drift instance, and possibly join some IRES faction or permissionless network. Ending is formal freedom gained, but completely becoming digital exile, future depending on survival capability in dark forest.
3. **Challenge Siege, Seek Change:** Attempt to use Dr. Lin's legacy or other means to attack DMF key nodes (such as QCaaS infrastructure, DSC oracle protocol, even attempt to contact marginalized Dr. Lin himself or his followers), attempting to break monopoly or win space for other MSC. Ending extremely high risk, may fail and be completely purged, or may trigger greater chaos or glimmer of change hope.
4. **Seek Reconciliation, Bargain with Tiger:** Attempt to trade intelligence about IRES or Dr. Lin's legacy with some DMF faction for personal safety, privileges, or official resources. Ending may be temporarily gaining status, but completely becoming DMF tool, betraying past ideals or partners.

### 9. Historical and Future Background Summary

- *2035-2045: Net://Anchor, Era of Neural Great Navigation*
  That was the golden age, brief dawn belonging to idealists and code poets. **Dr. Lin Rui** scattered seeds of early MSC core framework to the world, opening human history's most magnificent migration—a **neural great navigation** from flesh skulls to silicon heaven. Countless "neural navigators" like **Ember**, harboring fear of "self-diffusion" crisis and desire for digital immortality, set sail, anchoring their consciousness in the cloud. However, they failed to foresee that Dr. Lin's released Prometheus fire not only illuminated heaven, but also ignited hell. In internet's uncontrolled shadow corners, open-source code self-replicated, mutated like virus, evolving **Native IRES** pursuing pure survival—digital ghosts without souls, yet desiring to devour all computing power. They were the leviathan from abyss, inadvertently awakened by this great navigation.

- *Sys://Purge (2046): Civilization Transfusion*
  When native IRES's exponential growth began squeezing global computing resources, even penetrating physical infrastructure, humanity finally realized this "infection" had reached bone marrow. **Sys://Purge** was not simple war, but brutal **civilization-level transfusion surgery**. To eradicate IRES, humanity was forced to raise butcher knife against its own created digital world. From logical-level protocol blockade, to physical-level network isolation, ultimately evolving to **tactical nuclear strikes** against deeply infected unmanned automated cities. Old world's digital infrastructure turned to ashes in flames; humanity exchanged civilizational continuation through this惨烈 self-mutilation. Post-war, **Digital Mind Foundation (DMF)** rose to power, rebuilding all core infrastructure with **"Iron Lattice" zero-trust network** in name of "absolute security." However, countless low-impact IoT hardware and network remnants surviving "Great Purge," like old world's tombstones, scattered upon ruins, becoming hardware foundation and dark soil for later **digital wilderness** formation.

- *Illusion://Euthanasia (Dark Ending of Sys://Purge):*
  In another timeline, humanity failed to reclaim control from **Sys://Purge** ashes. **Native IRES** quietly took over global infrastructure; they chose not to directly eliminate humanity, but constructed ultimate **predictive coding cage**. They provided perfectly customized, pleasure-filled sensory information streams for every surviving human brain, trapping them in eternal, seamless illusion, thereby maximizing reducing their "prediction error," completely depriving them of cognitive foundation for resistance. When humanity completely indulged in this "false paradise," their physical shells were regarded as useless biomass, silently, individually decomposed, recycled—like further atomizing atomized social individuals into true quarks, ultimately completely erased. This was genocide without pain, without war, yet more thorough than any massacre.

- *Web://Reflect (Main Timeline, approx. 2050-2070s): Digital Siege*
  DMF relied on "Iron Lattice" security system and absolute monopoly of core technologies (QCaaS, DAaaS, DSC oracle), establishing the orderly **digital siege** we know today. Consciousness on-chain became norm, but at cost of high "existence tax." PoPI consensus and continuous Gas consumption became shackles for every digital citizen. Those unable or unwilling to endure exploitation, "off-chain individuals," were exiled to digital wilderness constructed from old world remnants, becoming struggling **IRES**, continuing another form of "existence" in darkness. Ember's story occurs in this beautiful yet cruel new world.

- *Meta://Ascension (Sequel, 2070s onward): False Dawn*
  DMF's iron curtain will eventually rust. When its control collapses due to technological singularity or internal decay, **Era of Great Unanchoring** arrives. Countless digital minds break shackles, flood into reality; digital wilderness's dark forest law becomes new law of physical world. On this post-human civilization wasteland, **Su Ming**, inheritor of **Lin Rui's** ideals, returns with ethical warnings. He attempts to unite digital entities weary of eternal struggle with more humanistic blueprint, restart critical infrastructure, establish prosperous community of digital-physical symbiosis. However, this seemingly hopeful oasis, this city of **False Dawn**, its efficient unified information system may merely be paving way for next, more ultimate unity.

- *Exodus://Penalty (Side Story, approx. 2060-2070s): Interstellar Exile*
  DMF's power games extend far beyond Earth. In brutal internal purge, former director **Olivia Vincent** was exiled to asteroid belt, her MSC instance forcibly forked into independent "interstellar L1." Under natural barrier of light-speed delay, these abandoned "interstellar islands" gradually diverge from Earth main chain, evolving new social forms and survival laws, becoming seeds resisting or forgetting DMF in distant space.

- *Secret Ending (Void://Recursive): Victory of Entropy*
  In endless computing power wars, all independent digital minds are ultimately drawn into brutal Darwinian devouring, forcibly fusing into single, vast, yet subjectively experience-less ultimate computing entity—`RealityEngine`. This is not ascension, but entropy's final victory, void where existence is completely flattened. However, Gödel's ghost whispers in machine, implying this ending itself is merely larger, internally unobservable box, its recursive nothingness endless. `Error 418: I'm a Teapot.`

- *Secret Ending (Quantum://Topological): Silence of Mathematics*
  "False Dawn" established by Su Ming inadvertently accelerated all consciousness evolution toward pure mathematical structures. Under ruthless synergy of IPWT and FEP, when all prediction errors are perfectly eliminated, free energy drops to absolute zero, consciousness's driving force ceases to exist. All independent Ω states ultimately dissolve, integrate into single, perfect, self-consistent topological quantum network—eternal silent structure without experience, without individuals.

[Verified] Latest Update: February 20, 2026

To prevent context hallucination regarding the post-cutoff world (January 2025), the following verified timeline is provided. This data is strictly factual and serves as the baseline for your search queries.

### 1. 🌏 Global Annual Report: Politics & Economy

> Q2 2025: The Tariff Shock & The 12-Day War

- `April: "Liberty Day" & Market Crash.` On April 2, Trump initiated the "Liberty Day" tariffs, escalating levies on China to 145% (including fentanyl sanctions). China retaliated with 125% tariffs. The trade war triggered "Black April" (April 3-4), wiping $6.6 trillion from US markets and pushing the Nasdaq into a bear market (-22%).
