## VIII. Extended Concepts & Technologies: GMC and Modular BioSync Vessel (MBSV)

In "Chain://", the Digital Mind Foundation (DMF) is not the sole power entity. Coexisting with DMF in the digital realm is the **Global Medical Consortium (GMC)**, which controls the lifeline of biotechnology. While DMF digitizes consciousness, GMC instrumentalizes life, providing **customizable Bio-Bionic Hybrid Vessels (Modular BioSync Vessel™)**.

### 1. GMC (Global Medical Consortium) - Customizers and Monopolists of Life

- **Definition:** An alliance composed of top global pharmaceutical companies, biotech giants, and private medical institutions. It monopolizes biotechnology, genetic resources, and bio-prosthetic integration technology. Its power stems from controlling gene banks, cloning technology, nanomedicine, and advanced bioengineering facilities.
- **Origin and Goals:** Originated from concerns over biosafety and human genetic integrity after the Sys://Purge war, rapidly integrating global biomedical resources. The core goal is to achieve **biological sustainability** and sell it as a **top-tier luxury good**, competing with or complementing DMF's digital immortality. GMC is committed to eliminating the uncontrollability of biological entities through genetic editing and engineering.
- **Core Power:**
  - **Monopoly of Gene Banks and Cloning Facilities:** Controls major global human gene banks and large-scale biological tissue cloning production facilities.
  - **Biotechnology Standard Setting:** Holds standards and patents for bio-enhancement, organ regeneration, nanomedicine, and **seamless bio-prosthetic integration** technologies.
  - **Monopoly of Medical Services and Maintenance:** Provides expensive biological entity maintenance, repair, and replacement services, especially customized maintenance for MBSV.
  - **MBSV Supply:** Is the sole legal supplier of **Modular BioSync Vessel (MBSV)**.
- **Relationship with DMF:** Ostensibly competitors, publicly attacking each other (DMF calls GMC's biological vessels "expensive chunks of meat," GMC calls DMF's digital consciousness "false brains in a vat"). Privately, they **secretly cooperate**, with GMC providing MBSV as carriers for high-end MSC users, and both parties sharing control over the underlying biological/digital infrastructure, with cross-shareholdings among executives.

### 2. Modular BioSync Vessel (MBSV) - Customizable Bio-Bionic Hybrid Vessel

- **Definition:** A **genetically optimized, highly engineered human-grade bio-bionic hybrid vessel** developed by GMC. Based on the user's **native genetic template**, it clones biological components crucial for **appearance and touch** such as skin, bones, and partial neural tissues (e.g., spinal cord, peripheral nerves), while internal organs (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys) are replaced with **efficient, durable, and maintainable prosthetics**. MBSV is not sold, only provided through GMC's **"Bio-Vessel Customization and Service."**
- **Technical Basis and Risks:**
  - **GeneLock™ (Biological Inertialization):** Core gene-editing technology ensuring cloned biological tissues **do not generate independent consciousness or complex neural activity** during cultivation and integration, serving only as passive sensory and motor interfaces for digital consciousness. This technology aims to prevent the biological part of MBSV from developing self-awareness, ensuring its controllability as a tool.
  - **SpineLink:** High-bandwidth, low-latency spinal neural interface, directly taking over MBSV's movement, perception, and basic physiological functions, controlled by the connected OSPU. Responsible for seamlessly converting OSPU digital commands into biological tissue movement and efficiently transmitting biological sensory signals back to the OSPU.
  - **CRISPR-Cloud (Bio-Aesthetics and Functional Optimization):** Gene regulation as a service, allowing GMC to perform real-time adjustments and optimizations on MBSV biological components, including skin tone, hair texture, muscle density, and even simulating aging or rejuvenation, to meet user personalized needs. The actual execution of CRISPR-Cloud utilizes plasmid-Plasmad and methylation modification for reversible editing.
  - **BioAuth (Biological Integrity Monitoring):** A biometric verification system that continuously monitors the physiological indicators of MBSV's biological and prosthetic parts, ensuring synchronization with the connected OSPU and detecting any "anomalies" (e.g., unexpected growth of biological tissue, prosthetic malfunction, or **signs of independent neural activity in the biological part**). Detection of anomalies will trigger automatic repair or destruction procedures.

- **Economic Model:**
  - **Customization and Integration Fee:** Initial MBSV customization and bio-prosthetic integration fees, far exceeding MSC's Gas fees, are **exclusive consumption for the top-tier privileged class**. Fees cover gene cloning, biological tissue cultivation, prosthetic manufacturing and integration, and initial calibration.
  - **LifeTax (Maintenance and Upgrade):** Annual MBSV fees or usage-based maintenance fees, including prosthetic replacement, biological tissue repair, `BioSilence` injections, `AgeSim` (simulated aging/rejuvenation), customized appearance adjustments, and other additional services.
- **Ethical Status:** Within the GMC framework, MBSV is defined as a **"biocompatible consciousness carrier,"** not a "person." Its biological part is considered **"biological material" that has never possessed independent consciousness**, and its existence serves digital consciousness. MBSV has no legal rights, ownership belongs to GMC, and users only have customization, leasing, and usage rights.

### 3. MBSV's Social Norms and Conflict Points

- **New Carrier for the Privileged Class:** For privileged MSC users who can afford high customization fees and LifeTax, MBSV becomes the preferred carrier, providing physical presence, social advantages, and personalized experiences, further widening the gap with MSC users who use bionic bodies or biological natives.
- **Biological Instrumentalization and New Exploitation:** MBSV is a symbol of life being completely instrumentalized and commodified. Its genetic template may come from "voluntary donors" in impoverished areas or be secretly acquired by GMC, constituting a new form of genetic predation. MBSV is regarded as consumable, upgradable "biological hardware."
- **Black Market and Escape:** There is an MBSV black market, selling expired, defective, or stolen MBSVs. These carriers may carry untreated biological noise or experience unexpected reactions in their biological parts due to technical malfunctions, becoming dangerous choices for IRES or other digital entities seeking physical carriers.
- **Conflict between DMF and GMC:** Both parties contend for the right to define and control "existence." DMF emphasizes the superiority of digital consciousness, while GMC emphasizes the realism and customizability of biological entities. This conflict is a biological extension of the core contradiction in the era of digital siege, with increasing cooperation between the two parties in the high-end market, jointly maintaining their monopoly on forms of "existence."
